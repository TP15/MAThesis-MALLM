Among these, the OBD2Connector, ChargingPlugConnector, and AftermarketDongle are noteworthy assets that demand our attention.\n\nThe OBD2Connector, a standard in most vehicles, serves as the gateway to the vehicle's onboard network. Physical access to this connector opens up possibilities for an attacker to gain network-layer access, thanks to its direct connection to the vehicle's CAN bus or other networks. To bypass any protective barriers, an attacker might resort to physically compromising the connector, such as removing a protective plate or gaining access to the driver's cabin.\n\nOn the other hand, the ChargingPlugConnector in electric vehicles offers access to the connected network's network layer, regardless of whether it provides direct CAN bus access or is linked to the Battery Management System (BMS) ECU. As with the OBD2Connector, gaining physical access to the ChargingPlugConnector grants an attacker network-layer access to the vehicle's systems.\n\nLastly, the AftermarketDongle, a device often connected to the OBD2Connector, offers additional functionality to vehicle owners, such as error log reading and configuration. When an attacker connects a dongle, they can potentially gain network-layer access to the OBD2Connector. However, if the dongle's firmware is hardened and cannot be modified by the attacker, this access may not be achievable.\n\nThese assets, each with their unique characteristics and vulnerabilities, serve as crucial points for both attackers and defenders in the automotive security landscape.
