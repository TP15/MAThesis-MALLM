This SIS, an automated system designed to maintain or transition a plant to a safe state during abnormal conditions, is categorized under IcsControlResources.\n\nThe SIS, an instance of IcsHardware, is a crucial safeguard for our systems. It can be manually or automatically triggered to shut down connected assets, in response to the loss of safety within the safeguarded system.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the SIS might not always be present due to various reasons, such as removal or malfunction. In such cases, the probability of the SIS being offline should be carefully considered, as it could potentially lead to safety mechanisms becoming unavailable. This scenario is represented by the 'notDisabled' attribute within the SIS asset.\n\nInterestingly, if a SIS is intentionally or unintentionally removed from a safeguarded system, it will be recorded as one of the safety mechanisms being offline. Moreover, the removal or deactivation of a SIS could trigger a propagation of redundant shutdown events across the network, depending on the system's design.\n\nIn summary, the Safety Instrumented System (SIS) within our ICS network plays a vital role in ensuring the safety of our operations.

This SIS is designed to automatically initiate corrective action when abnormal conditions are detected, ensuring the system remains safe or is safely shut down.\n\nThe SIS, represented as 'SIS' in our model, extends the IcsHardware category. According to the developer's documentation, a SIS is primarily used to safeguard industrial control systems (ICS) and prevent potential catastrophic failures.\n\nOne significant attribute of our SIS is the 'shutdown' function, which is an override action that triggers when the safeguarded system experiences a loss of safety. This function is crucial for ensuring the system's safety even in the face of such events.\n\nAnother essential aspect of our SIS is the 'notDisabled' state. This state represents the probability that the SIS is not actually functioning, which could occur due to removal or malfunction. This state is marked as 'Enabled' by default and is used for scenarios such as the intentional removal of the SIS safeguarding an ICS or the elimination of redundant SIS subsystems.\n\nIn the event of the 'notDisabled' state being triggered, the system will mark the associated safeguarded system as having safety mechanisms offline and propagate a redundant shutdown, ensuring the system remains secure.", "output": "asset SIS extends IcsHardware\n        user info: \"A safety instrumented system (SIS) takes automated action to keep a plant in a safe state, or to put it into a safe state, when abnormal conditions are present.\"\n        developer info: \"https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Safety_Instrumented_System/Protection_Relay\"\n      {\n        | shutdown @Override\n            +> safeguardedSystem.lossOfSafety\n\n        # notDisabled @Override [Enabled]\n          developer info: \"The probability that a particular SIS is not actually present.\"\n          modeler info: \"The use cases for this are removing the SIS safeguarding an IcsHardware and removing redundant SIS subsystems.\"\n          -> safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline,\n             triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown\n\n      }"}
