This device hosts the control software essential for communication with lower-level devices in an ICS network. Although it's primarily concerned with control functions, it's worth noting that certain attack steps pertaining to manipulation of views or loss of views may not be directly relevant to this asset.\n\nThe Control Server, being an extension of the IcsApplication, inherits several attributes, such as its operational environment, communication protocols, and potential vulnerabilities. Its user-facing information describes it as a crucial node in the ICS network, handling the critical flow of commands and data.\n\nThis asset, being a server, is likely to have connections with numerous other components in the system, such as control devices and possibly user interfaces. Understanding these associations is crucial for maintaining the security of the entire ICS network.\n\nFor any security analyst, it's essential to familiarize oneself with the Control Server's developer information, available at the Mitre Collaborate website, for a more comprehensive understanding of its roles, behaviors, and potential attack vectors.", "output": "category IcsControlResources{\n\n    asset ControlServer extends IcsApplication \n        user info: \"A device which acts as both a server and controller, that hosts the control software used in communicating with lower-level control devices in an ICS network.\"\n        developer info: \"https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Control_Server\"\n      {\n      // Override view related attack steps (Impact) becase they are not relevant to this asset\n      | manipulationOfView @Override\n\n      | lossOfView @Override\n      }\n\n}"}
