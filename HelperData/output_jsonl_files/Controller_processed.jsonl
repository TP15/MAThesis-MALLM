{"instruction": "Given these related assets, write a category definition in Meta Attack Language.", "input": "During a recent assessment, we encountered an ICS control resource categorized as a Controller. This ICS Application employs programmable logic to perform scanning and data exchange with I/O interface modules, communicating with the control system network via serial and network communications. The Controller's origin can be traced from the Mitre collaboration platform, specifically related to Field Controllers, RTUs, PLCs, and IEDs.\n\nInterestingly, this particular Controller may feature a physical lock mechanism, which prevents any modifications to the programmable logic. This added security measure makes the Controller resistant to manipulations, thus adding a layer of protection against potential threats. It's worth noting that such a lock could potentially impact the Controller's flexibility in terms of updates and configuration changes, so it's essential to consider the implications carefully.\n\nIn our analysis, we found that the presence of the physical lock directly affects the Controller's manipulation capabilities, as it disallows any unauthorized modifications to the programmable logic. This relationship between the lock and the Controller's manipulation functionalities serves as a crucial point to consider when evaluating the Controller's overall security posture.", "output": "category IcsControlResources{\n\n    asset Controller extends IcsApplication \n        user info: \"Controllers utilize a programmable logic-based application that provides scanning and writing of data to and from the IO interface modules and communicates with the control system network via various communications methods, including serial and network communications.\"\n        developer info: \"https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Field_Controller/RTU/PLC/IED\"\n      {\n        # physicalLock\n          user info: \"A controller can have a physical lock in place that disallows modifications on the programmable logic, thus making it invulnerable to manipulations.\"\n          ->  manipulate\n\n      }\n\n}"}
