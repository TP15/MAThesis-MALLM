{"instruction": "Given these related assets, write a category definition in Meta Attack Language.", "input": "In this system model, we have several categories of assets, including Physical Machines, Sensors or Actuators, Machines, ECUs, GatewayECUs, Vehicular Applications, Firmware, Operating Systems, Services, Clients, NetworkClients, VehicleNetworkReceivers, NetworkServices, UDSServices, TransmitterServices, and FirmwareUpdaterServices.\n\nPhysical Machines are any machines in the system, and they can connect directly to other machines without authentication. Sensors and actuators are a subset of physical machines that can be manipulated once access is obtained. Machines are more complex physical machines and can be accessed through various means, including attempting to connect, authenticate, bypass access control, or exploit connection vulnerabilities.\n\nECUs, or Engine Control Units, are specialized machines found in vehicles. They can connect to other machines, change their operation mode, upload malicious firmware, and manipulate connected sensors or actuators. GatewayECUs act as firewalls on vehicles and can forward traffic, bypass firewalls, and deny access to connected networks.\n\nVehicular Applications include Firmware, Operating Systems, Services, Clients, NetworkClients, VehicleNetworkReceivers, NetworkServices, UDSServices, TransmitterServices, and FirmwareUpdaterServices. These applications can have specific access, full access, or service message injection.\n\nFirmware is an application running on an ECU and can be updated maliciously by bypassing secure boot or firmware validation. Operating Systems, Services, Clients, NetworkClients, VehicleNetworkReceivers, NetworkServices, UDSServices, TransmitterServices, and FirmwareUpdaterServices are all types of vehicular applications with specific functionalities.\n\nNetworkClients represent clients connected to a service running on a network, while VehicleNetworkReceivers represent receivers/clients for connectionless dataflows connected to a transmitter running on a vehicle network. NetworkServices represent services running on top of a network, and UDSServices specifically represent the Unified Diagnostics Service (UDS) running on an ECU. TransmitterServices represent services or transmitters running on an ECU and on top of a vehicle network. FirmwareUpdaterServices represent the firmware updating procedure or UDS service on an ECU.", "output": "category System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

{"instruction": "Define the following group of assets under a single category using Meta Attack Language.", "input": "In this threat modeling document, we outline several components of a Modeling Attack Language (MAL) code focused on vehicle networking. The primary categories include various types of vehicle networks, each with their unique attributes and associated attack steps.\n\n1. **VehicleNetwork**: This is a broad category encompassing different types of vehicle networks such as CAN bus, FlexRay, and LIN bus. Each network type has specific attributes and is extended from the coreLang.\n\n   - **PhysicalAccess**: Physical access to the network. This access allows an attacker to connect to network layers and perform various actions such as eavesdropping, message injection, and denial of service (DoS).\n\n   - **AccessUninspected**: Access to the network without the ability to listen to others' traffic. An attacker outside the router can communicate into the network but not eavesdrop on other traffic.\n\n   - **AccessNetworkLayer**: Network layer access allows an attacker to submit messages over the network and listen to others' traffic. This level of access enables eavesdropping, message injection, and various other network-specific attacks.\n\n   - **Eavesdrop**: An attacker can intercept and listen to network traffic, potentially gaining sensitive information.\n\n   - **MessageInjection**: Injecting messages into the network allows an attacker to transmit malicious messages, potentially causing DoS or requesting information from other nodes.\n\n   - **Deny**: Denying network access makes the network unavailable, effectively performing a DoS attack.\n\n2. **CANNetwork**: A specific type of vehicle network that represents the CAN bus network and its associated attacks.\n\n   - **ExploitArbitration**: Exploiting the arbitration mechanism for message prioritization in CAN bus can lead to invalidation of legitimate messages/DoS and allow message tampering/injection.\n\n   - **BusOffAttack**: Exploiting the error-handling scheme of in-vehicle networks to disconnect good/uncompromised ECUs or cause DoS on the entire network. This attack is applicable on CAN-FD networks as well.\n\n   - **BusOffProtection**: A defense mechanism to prevent the busOffAttack.\n\n3. **J1939Network**: A specific type of vehicle network that employs the SAE J1939 protocol in heavy-duty vehicles.\n\n   - **Eavesdrop**: An attacker can eavesdrop/sniff the network.\n\n   - **AdversaryInTheMiddle**: Attackers can intercept and tamper with communications.\n\n   - **Deny**: A DoS attack can happen on a J1939 network, with three possible ways as described in related papers.\n\n   - **MessageInjection**: Inject messages to J1939 means that an attacker can make requests towards other J1939 nodes or PGNs (Parameter Group Number) and after effort to maliciously respond.\n\n   - **J1939MessageInjection**: A more specific form of messageInjection on J1939 networks.\n\n   - **_advancedJ1939Attacks**: Advanced attacks on J1939 networks, which may not be successful if only limited parts of the J1939 protocol are used.\n\n4. **FlexRayNetwork**: A specific type of vehicle network representing the FlexRay network and its associated attacks.\n\n   - **CommonTimeBaseAttack**: Send more than needed SYNC messages within one communication cycle to make the whole network inoperable.\n\n   - **ExploitBusGuardian**: Utilize Bus Guardian for sending well-directed faked error messages to deactivate controllers.\n\n   - **SleepFrameAttack**: Send well-directed forged sleep frames to deactivate power-saving capable FlexRay controller.\n\n5. **LINNetwork**: A specific type of vehicle network representing the LIN bus network and its associated attacks.\n\n   - **InjectBogusSyncBytes**: Sending frames with bogus synchronization bytes within the SYNCH field makes the local LIN network inoperative or causes at least serious malfunctions.\n\n   - **GainLINAccessFromCAN**: Techniques to gain access to the LIN bus through a CAN-bus node.\n\n   - **InjectHeaderOrTimedResponse**: A specific attack that can happen on LIN bus exploiting the error handling mechanism, but it is not so easy.\n\n   - **_hiddenAttackSteps**: Intermediate attack steps that help reach", "output": "category Networking {\n\n    asset VehicleNetwork extends Network\n        user info: \"Vehicle Networks include CAN bus, FlexRay and LIN bus.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n        //Override\n        | physicalAccess\n                user info: \"Physical access to the network.

{"instruction": "Model the following group of assets under a category using Meta Attack Language.", "input": "In the realm of our system architecture, we have identified several key components that play a vital role in data transmission, each with unique characteristics and associated risks. One such category is the Communication, encompassing various assets like Dataflow, ConnectionOrientedDataflow, and ConnectionlessDataflow.\n\nDataflow, as a channel for data in transit, can be subject to several attack steps. For instance, an eavesdropper can gain unauthorized access to data, potentially compromising its confidentiality, albeit encrypted data may prevent a breach of confidentiality. On the other hand, a denial-of-service-attack can make the data inaccessible, although the information may be available elsewhere.\n\nConnectionOrientedDataflow, a unicast or multicast transmission, is particularly susceptible to a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. In such an attack, the attacker can control the data, potentially compromising both its confidentiality and integrity. However, it's worth noting that confliction protection mechanisms can slow down the attacker's actions.\n\nConnectionlessDataflow, a multicast or broadcast transmission, also faces similar risks, such as eavesdropping and MitM attacks. The attacker can control the data, potentially compromising confidentiality and integrity, and bypassing the confliction protection mechanism to achieve these goals.\n\nIn addition to these attack steps, we have identified various assets like requests, responses, and malicious transmissions, each with their unique behaviors and associations with the dataflow assets.

A compromise of this identity could lead to authenticated access on machines, data, and even other connected identities. Assuming an identity provides access to several actions such as authenticating on machines, connecting to machines, authorized read, write, and delete of private data, and even attempting to assume child identities.\n\nVehicularCredentials, an extended form of the standard Credentials, store a firmware access key. Reading this key can lead to impersonation of identities during data transmission, as well as passing firmware validation and potential firmware modification on connected machines.\n\nLastly, MessageID is an asset that represents the ID on the header of a transmitted packet/message/dataflow.

Regular firmware uploads without proper validation can also lead to the same outcome.\n\nThe ECU's network access is a common entry point for attacks, allowing attackers to meddle with vehicular networks, eavesdrop on messages, or inject their own.

This ECU, identified as a subtype of the ECU, is equipped with full access rights, allowing it to act as a protective barrier for the rest of the system.\n\nThe GatewayECU's primary function is forwarding, which involves retransmitting received messages. Although this interaction is relatively light, it carries the risk of compromising the gateway and the associated firewall. This leads to a direct association with the 'connect' step, where an adversary may establish a connection after bypassing the firewall.\n\nIn scenarios where the firewall is disabled, the attacker can bypass it, leading to several consequences. Firstly, the attacker can manipulate the gateway without interference from the Internal Defense Protection System (IDPS), as evidenced by the 'gatewayBypassIDPS' association. Secondly, the absence of IDPS enables unrestricted access to the network, as indicated by the 'gatewayNoIDPS' association.\n\nThe firewall protection on the GatewayECU is contingent upon a correctly configured firewall. If the firewall is bypassed, the attacker can attempt a denial of service (DoS) attack on the connected networks, as suggested by the 'deny' association.\n\nIt's worth noting that the presence of an IDPS is checked within the system. If an IDPS is found, the GatewayECU will bypass it only if the firewall is disabled, leading to the 'trafficVNetworks._bypassIDPS' association. Conversely, if an IDPS is not detected, the GatewayECU will provide unhindered access to the network, as indicated by the 'trafficVNetworks._noIDPS' association. Access to the network layer is also granted immediately if an IDPS is not present.\n\nIn summary, the GatewayECU serves as a critical control point in the vehicle's network, acting as both a gateway and a firewall.

This firmware, denoted as 'Firmware', serves as the backbone for various functionalities within the vehicle.\n\nTwo notable attack steps are associated with this asset: 'maliciousFirmwareModification' and 'hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload'. The former involves performing a firmware update either by cracking Secure Boot or, more dangerously, by exploiting its absence. The latter, 'hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload', is the action of uploading malicious firmware to the ECU.\n\nInterestingly, the 'Firmware' asset is guarded by a validation mechanism, denoted as 'firmwareValidation'. This mechanism employs code signing and verification during upload, strong checksum functions, and ensures that private keys for signing are not distributed. However, if this mechanism is bypassed or not enabled, an attacker could potentially upload malicious firmware using the 'bypassFirmwareValidation' or 'hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload' attack steps.\n\nAnother key protection mechanism in our system is Secure Boot, denoted as 'secureBoot'. Secure Boot validates the boot software and the firmware at system boot time, providing an additional layer of security against forged firmware. However, if Secure Boot is bypassed or not enabled, attackers may resort to cracking firmware validation (denoted as 'crackFirmwareValidation') or even bypassing it entirely (denoted as 'bypassFirmwareValidation'). These bypass methods can potentially lead to the uploading of malicious firmware.\n\nIt's essential to note that the 'crackSecureBoot' and 'bypassSecureBoot' attack steps are more challenging due to the robustness of Secure Boot. Therefore, attackers might find it harder to exploit Secure Boot if it is enabled, making these attack steps less likely.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency, we'd like to mention that the 'firmwareValidation' and 'secureBoot' mechanisms were developed by RubiconLabs, while the 'Secure Boot' concept is a well-known protection mechanism in the automotive security industry.", "output": "asset Firmware extends VehicularApplication\n        user info: \"Specifies the firmware running on an ECU as an application.\"\n    {\n        | maliciousFirmwareModification\n                user info: \"Perform a firmware update either by cracking Secure Boot or worse by exploiting the absence of it.\"\n                ->  bypassSecureBoot,\n                    crackSecureBoot\n\n        & crackFirmwareValidation [Exponential(0.2)]\n                user info: \"Crack firmware validation if it is enabled.\"\n                ->  hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload\n\n        & bypassFirmwareValidation\n                user info: \"Bypass firmware validation if it is not enabled.\"\n                ->  hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload\n\n        # firmwareValidation\n                user info: \"Code signing and verification during upload, use of strong checksum functions and/or don't distribute the private keys for signing.\"\n                developer info: \"Rubicon - Zero-knowledge Armor for Automotive Security, RubiconLabs\"\n                ->\tbypassFirmwareValidation\n\n        & bypassSecureBoot\n                user info: \"Bypass Secure Boot if it is not enabled Then validate a firmware update either by cracking (brute forcing) the checksum or worse by exploiting the absence of verification.\"\n                ->  bypassFirmwareValidation,\n                    crackFirmwareValidation\n\n        | crackSecureBoot [Exponential(0.1)]\n                user info: \"Crack Secure Boot if it is enabled is hard\"\n                ->  hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload\n\n        # secureBoot\n                user info: \"SecureBoot is a protection mechanism that validates the boot software and the firmware at system boot time.\"\n                developer info: \"SecureBoot should make running of forged firmware even harder when enabled.

When set to true, it provides the client with unrestricted access to the service's data, allowing it to initiate requests as needed. This could potentially expose sensitive information if not properly managed.\n\nIt's worth noting that the `NetworkClient`'s interaction with the service is primarily through dataflows, with the `request` dataflow being the main avenue for sending requests to the service. This dataflow is directly associated with the `fullAccess` attribute, suggesting that when `fullAccess` is granted, the client is able to send requests as it sees fit.\n\nIn a threat modeling context, the `NetworkClient` could be a potential point of entry for an attacker, especially if the `fullAccess` flag is not appropriately secured.

This network is integral to the vehicle's functioning, and understanding potential vulnerabilities is crucial.\n\nThe CAN Network, represented by the `CANNetwork` asset, is subject to certain attack steps that could compromise its integrity. One such attack step is the `_networkSpecificAttack`, which serves as an intermediary step towards network-specific attacks. This attack step can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) scenarios, message tampering, and injection through the exploitation of arbitration mechanisms used for message prioritization. This type of attack has been documented in works like the Jeep Hack and the Security shortcomings and countermeasures for the SAE J1939 commercial vehicle bus protocol.\n\nAnother notable attack step is `exploitArbitration`, which has a probability of occurrence of 0.1. This attack exploits the arbitration mechanism to invalidate legitimate messages, causing a Denial of Service, and allowing message tampering and injection. Successful execution of this attack enables direct malicious respond and request, differentiating it from the messageInjection attack.\n\nAdditionally, we've identified the `busOffAttack` with a probability of occurrence of 0.1. This attack exploits the error-handling scheme of in-vehicle networks to disconnect ECUs or cause a Denial of Service on the entire network. This attack is relatively easy to mount and is applicable on both traditional CAN and CAN-FD networks.\n\nLastly, we've noted the `busOffProtection` measure, which is based on a defense mechanism proposed in the paper \"Error Handling of In-vehicle Networks Makes Them Vulnerable (2016)\".

This issue was first identified by Marko Wolf and can be mitigated by denying such frames from being transmitted.\n\nAnother attack pathway is gaining access to the LIN bus through a CAN-bus node.

Furthermore, the compromised identity could also connect to other identities, potentially spreading the attacker's reach.\n\nIt's crucial to remember that the VehicularIdentity asset, being an extension of Identity, shares similar characteristics.

One such operation is the 'readFirmwareAccessKey' function, which is designed to fetch a stored firmware validation/access key for the connected vehicles. This action is crucial, as it grants access to various vehicle systems and functions, such as passing firmware validation, modifying the firmware through UDS (Diagnostic Session), accessing the vehicles after firmware validation, and modifying the firmware through UDS post validation.\n\nIn essence, the 'readFirmwareAccessKey' action is a vital step in establishing secure communication with the targeted vehicles, and it serves as a stepping stone for further manipulation of vehicle firmware.

This entity is essentially the identifier that gets affixed to a packet, message, or dataflow as it traverses the network.\n\nThe MessageID is a crucial piece of information, as it serves as a unique identifier for each data exchange. In some cases, an attacker might attempt to manipulate the MessageID for malicious purposes, such as spoofing or replay attacks.\n\nOne interesting association we've noticed is that the dataflow's receiver may attempt to impersonate the MessageID during certain interactions. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources or services.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the act of reading the MessageID is a significant step in understanding the context of a data exchange. This action is tied directly to the dataflow's receiver, and it could provide valuable insights into the nature of the data being transferred.\n\nLastly, it's important to remember that the security implications of the MessageID extend beyond just its reading.

Each machine may have one or more executed applications, such as a VehicularApplication, that perform specific functions. These applications are granted access privileges to the machine, which could include user information required for their operation.\n\nAdditionally, machines may have connect privileges that allow anyone who connects to them to access certain resources. This could include network machines, which represent the physical devices with which the machine communicates.\n\nApplications are assigned certain VehicularIdentities, which grant them specific privileges on the platform. When an application is compromised, the attacker gains these privileges on the platform.\n\nWe also have VehicleNetworks, which represent the overall network structure of the vehicle. These networks use dataflows for communication, which transmit data between network clients (such as NetworkClients) and network services (such as NetworkServices). Each dataflow can have a unique identifier for easy tracking.\n\nIn terms of data transmission, we have both connection-oriented and connectionless dataflows. Connectionless dataflows are used by transmitter services for sending data, and by receiver devices for receiving data on the vehicle network.\n\nFor managing security, we have an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS), which can be connected to a GatewayECU for centralized protection. Machines within the network may have connection and access vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by attackers.\n\nECUs, or Electronic Control Units, are another important component in the vehicle's network. Each ECU can have one or more firmware running on it, and may have a dedicated firmware updater UDS service for handling updates. An ECU can also be connected to physical machines such as sensors or actuators.\n\nFinally, we have FirmwareUpdaterServices that can be connected to a vehicle network for accepting incoming connections, facilitating firmware updates for the various ECUs within the network.", "output": "associations {\n    Machine\t[hostMachine]                   0..1 <-- machineExecution       --> *           [machineExecutedApps]   VehicularApplication\n    VehicularIdentity \t[vehicularIdentity]     * <-- AccessPrivileges\t        --> *           [accessedMachines]      Machine\n        user info: \"These identities grant access to the machine.\"\n    VehicularIdentity \t[connectPrivileges]     * <-- ConnectionPrivileges      --> *           [connectMachines]       Machine\n        user info: \"These privileges are granted to anyone who connects to a machine.\"\n    VehicularIdentity \t[assignedVehicularIdentity]     * <-- Assignment                --> *           [assignedApplications]  VehicularApplication\n        user info: \"Applications needs to be granted certain privileges when executing on a platform.
