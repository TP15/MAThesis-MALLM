{"instruction": "Translate the following cybersecurity system into a full Meta Attack Language specification, including asset classes, categories, and associations.", "input": "In the realm of our system, we've got a distinct language category dedicated to vehicle systems, identified by the identifier \"org.mal-lang.vehicleLang\". This language version is 2.0.0, built upon the core language and vehicle-specific language files.\n\nThe heart of this language is the 'Vehicle' asset, a physical entity equipped with sensors, actuators, and communications systems. It has a unique identity, specific make and model, and is characterized by its current location, speed, and fuel level.\n\nThe 'Vehicle' asset is intricately connected with several other components. It communicates with the 'GPS' asset, allowing it to track its location and movement. The 'Odometer' asset provides information on the vehicle's total mileage, while the 'FuelSensor' asset keeps tabs on the vehicle's fuel level.\n\nThe 'Vehicle' asset also interacts with the 'Engine' asset, controlling its operations through actuators. The engine, in turn, affects the vehicle's speed and fuel consumption.\n\nIn terms of potential threats, an attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the vehicle's communication system to send malicious commands to the engine, potentially leading to unauthorized acceleration or deceleration, or even engine shutdown. Similarly, tampering with the fuel sensor readings could allow an attacker to manipulate the vehicle's fuel level, potentially causing it to run out of fuel at an inconvenient time.\n\nLastly, it's crucial to note that the 'Vehicle' asset depends on the 'PowerSource' asset, which provides the energy necessary for all its electronic components to function properly. A failure in the power source could render the vehicle incapable of performing any of its intended functions.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal-lang.vehicleLang\"\n#version: \"2.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"org.mal-lang.coreLang/coreLang.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLang.mal\""}
