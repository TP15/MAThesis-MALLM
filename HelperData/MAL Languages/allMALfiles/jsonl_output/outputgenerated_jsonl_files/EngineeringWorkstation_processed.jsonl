The purpose of this function is to simulate scenarios where the controllers' programming might be unknown, irrelevant, or temporary. However, in most cases, it would be more appropriate to use the Network and ConnectionRule assets to propagate such attacks, as they provide a more accurate representation of how controllers are typically programmed.\n\nOnce the 'reprogramControllers' function is initiated, it triggers an attempt to manipulate programmableControllers, potentially leading to unintended consequences in the system if not properly managed.", "output": "category IcsControlResources{\n\n    asset EngineeringWorkstation extends IcsApplication \n        user info: \"The engineering workstation is usually a high-end very reliable computing platform designed for configuration, maintenance and diagnostics of the control system applications and other control system equipment.\"\n      {\n        | fullAccess @Override\n          +> reprogramControllers\n\n        | reprogramControllers\n          user info: \"Reprogram all of the controllers that the engineering station has access to.\"\n          modeler info: \"This is meant to simulate situations where how the controllers are programmed is unknown, irrelevant, or over a temporary connection.
