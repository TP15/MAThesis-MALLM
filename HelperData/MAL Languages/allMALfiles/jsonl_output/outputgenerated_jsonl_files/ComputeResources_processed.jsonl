{"instruction": "Write a Meta Attack Language snippet that models the entire threat landscape below, including asset types, logical groupings (categories), and how they are connected (associations).", "input": "In this security assessment report, we've identified several key components within the organization's IT infrastructure that could be potential targets for attackers. These components are primarily categorized under the ComputeResources category, which includes Hardware, Software, and Applications.\n\nHardware assets represent the physical devices on which applications can run. These devices could have vulnerabilities that can be exploited through physical access or software vulnerabilities. For instance, an attacker might attempt to use a vulnerability found in the physical access of a device, bypass hardware modifications protection, and then spread malware through removable media.\n\nSoftware assets, specifically SoftwareProducts, represent specific software packages that certain applications are using. These software products can be associated with certain vulnerabilities or have their deployment repositories compromised in a software supply chain attack. In such cases, if the origin of a software product is compromised, it could be interpreted as a software supply chain attack, and associated applications should also be compromised.\n\nApplications are versatile assets that model various software processes or components, such as firmware, operating systems, plugins, sessions, and more. Applications can have vulnerabilities associated with them, and an attacker may try to exploit these vulnerabilities. Additionally, applications can connect to other applications, networks, and data.\n\nIn terms of relationships, hardware systems are associated with physical zones, where they are physically deployed. Gaining access to a physical zone provides physical access to the housed hardware and networks. Applications can be hosted on hardware systems, and an IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System) can provide protection to other applications. Furthermore, applications can be associated with a software product that has specific characteristics such as specific vulnerabilities and deployment repository.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ConputerResourceslang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

{"instruction": "Create a valid Meta Attack Language definition for the described asset category.", "input": "The ComputeResources category encompasses various assets that make up the computational infrastructure of a system. The primary asset here is Hardware, which serves as the foundation for applications to run. This hardware can be compromised through several attack steps, such as attempting to use vulnerabilities from physical access, successful use of vulnerabilities, or spreading a worm through removable media.\n\nHardware can also be subject to a supply chain attack, where the attacker gains control of the hardware before it is put into use. In such cases, full access on the hardware grants access to all applications running on it and the data it hosts.\n\nSoftware products, representing specific software packages, can be associated with certain applications. If the origin of a software product is compromised, this is interpreted as a software supply chain attack, and the associated applications should also be fully compromised.\n\nApplications, the most common assets in models, represent any type of software process or component. They can be targeted via vulnerabilities, unsafe user activities, or network connections. If an attacker gains full access on an application, they can perform any actions within its execution context, including reading, modifying, and denying data.\n\nAn IDPS, an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System, is tasked with protecting other applications from malicious activity.

{"instruction": "Model this cybersecurity attack using Meta Attack Language syntax.", "input": "In our system, the hardware asset is the foundation for running applications, and it's crucial to understand its security posture. This hardware could potentially be targeted through various attack steps, including physical access, software vulnerabilities, supply chain compromise, and unsafe user activities.\n\nPhysical access can lead to attempts at using vulnerabilities found within the hardware, bypassing hardware modifications protection, or spreading malware through removable media. Once physical access is gained, the attacker can deny service, read, or modify the data stored on the hardware.\n\nSoftware vulnerabilities can be exploited once an attacker gains full access to the hardware, granting them control over the running applications and access to the hosted data. This can be done through various intermediate steps like using vulnerabilities, attempting to abuse vulnerabilities, or spreading worms through removable media.\n\nSupply chain compromise attacks target the hardware before it is put into use.
