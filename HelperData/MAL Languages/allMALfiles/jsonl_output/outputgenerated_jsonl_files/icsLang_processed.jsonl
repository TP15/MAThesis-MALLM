{"instruction": "Design a complete Meta Attack Language model that includes asset definitions, grouped categories, and associations for the scenario below.", "input": "In this MAL code, we have defined several components within the category of ComputeResources. These components include assets such as IcsHardware, IcsApplication, Sensor, and Actuator, each with their unique attributes and behaviors.\n\n1. IcsHardware represents the physical hardware components of an Industrial Control System (ICS), such as controllers, servers, historians, engineering workstations, HMIs, I/O servers, and SIS. IcsHardware can either be critical or redundant within a system, and each has specific attack steps and associations.\n\n   - Critical IcsHardware is part of the critical subsystem, and a disruption in any of the critical subsystems will trigger a disruption in the parent system as well.\n   - Redundant IcsHardware is part of the redundant subsystem, and a disruption will propagate to the parent system only if all of the redundant subsystems are affected by it.\n   - SafetyControls, represented by SIS, are assigned to IcsHardware to ensure that it is operating within safe parameters and act if it is not.\n\n2. IcsApplication represents the software applications running on the IcsHardware, such as control logic, human-machine interfaces, and data historians. IcsApplications can transmit and receive signals, which may be control signals or data signals.\n\n   - Transmitted signals from an IcsApplication can be associated with sensors or actuators, depending on the nature of the signal.\n   - Received signals by an IcsApplication can be control signals, which will manipulate or block the associated actuator, or data signals, which will manipulate the view or control of the destination system.\n\n3. Sensor and Actuator are assets that represent physical devices that generate data or consume data, respectively. Sensors can be associated with IcsHardware, signals, data, and the system they belong to. Actuators can be associated with signals, data, and the system they belong to.\n\n4. Signal, ControlSignal, IcsData, and IcsControlData are assets representing the information transmitted over the ICS network. Signals can be encrypted, and the encryption credentials can be associated with the encrypted signal. Contained data and information can also be associated with signals.\n\n5. Associations define the relationships between the components. For instance, IcsHardware can have an SIS assigned to it, an IcsApplication can transmit or receive signals, a sensor can be associated with a signal, data, or system, and an actuator can be associated with a signal or data.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ICSlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"org.mal-lang.coreLang/coreLang.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/Controller.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/ControlServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/DataHistorian.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/EngineeringWorkstation.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/HMI.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/IOServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/SIS.mal\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"instruction": "Given these related assets, write a category definition in Meta Attack Language.", "input": "In the ComputeResources category, we have several assets, each with unique characteristics and vulnerabilities.\n\nThe IcsHardware asset, an extension of the general Hardware, offers additional attack vectors for an ICS system. It can be accessed physically or fully, leading to potential losses of safety, control, view, availability, and manipulation of both control and view. Modular hardware devices within IcsHardware may have malicious or vulnerable firmware installed, which can provide full access to the system.\n\nMitigations for this include module firmware verification upon boot-up or during normal operation, using a cryptographic key for firmware updates, and implementing authenticated firmware updates.\n\nThe system firmware, another component of IcsHardware, can be exploited to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware, leading to full access.\n\nIn some cases, the ICS system may not be connected to a Safety Instrumented System (SIS), which could result in safety mechanisms being disabled if such a connection is expected.\n\nAttack steps related to IcsHardware include preemptive shutdown attempts, loss of safety, shutdown, and damage to property. These steps can propagate to parent systems if critical or redundant subsystems experience similar issues.\n\nIcsApplication, an extension of the general Application, presents attack vectors specific to Operational Technology (OT). It can be accessed specifically or fully, leading to normal operation, restricted operation, read access, and denial of access to control, view, and availability.\n\nManipulation of control and view can occur when the application is operating normally but undetectably manipulated. Theft of operational information is also possible.\n\nOther assets include Sensor, Actuator, and SynchronizationModule, each with their own unique characteristics and vulnerabilities. For instance, physical access to a sensor can lead to signal manipulation or blocking, data manipulation or denial, and losses of view and manipulation of view on the associated system. Actuator manipulation can lead to manipulation of control on the associated system, while blocking can result in loss of control and loss of availability. SynchronizationModule compromise can lead to manipulation of clock frequency, manipulation of time, and stopping the clock, which in turn can impact synchronized applications' control and view.", "output": "category ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"instruction": "Group the following assets into a category using the correct Meta Attack Language syntax.", "input": "In this MAL code, we have a category named DataResources that encompasses several assets and their related attack steps and associations.\n\nThe primary asset under DataResources is Signal, which represents information transmitted between assets, regardless of the medium. If data or information is transmitted over a known medium, other assets such as IcsData or DataInTransit should be used instead. The Signal asset defines various attack steps, including attemptAccess, access, attemptRead, attemptWrite, and attemptDelete. If the data is encrypted, accessing it requires the associated encryption credentials/key, and if the data is authenticated, modifying it is not possible. The Signal asset also has an extension called ControlSignal, which represents control commands.\n\nAnother asset within DataResources is IcsData, an extension of coreLang's Data with OT attack vectors and directionality for non-control information. When modifying or deleting IcsData, it results in a manipulation of view on the destination(s) and a manipulation of control on the source(s), while denying access to the data leads to a loss of view and control on both the source(s) and destination(s).\n\nSimilarly, IcsControlData is another asset that extends Data and represents control information sent over the OT network. Modifying or deleting IcsControlData leads to a manipulation of view and control on the affected systems, while denying access results in a loss of view and control.\n\nThere are also associations defined in this code, such as DataInTransit, which is used when data or information is transmitted over a known medium.

{"instruction": "Given this cyber incident, write its equivalent representation in Meta Attack Language.", "input": "In this ICS system, we have an extension of the core language's System called ICSHardware. This extension introduces more potential attack vectors due to its unique attributes. The ICS system may contain modular hardware devices, each with their own firmware that can be vulnerable or malicious.\n\nAdversaries might exploit these modular hardware devices by installing malicious firmware, taking advantage of outdated firmware, or even bypassing firmware verification processes. This can lead to full access to the system, resulting in various impacts such as loss of safety, loss of control, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, it's important to verify the module's firmware upon boot-up or during normal operation, use cryptography keys for firmware updates, and implement authenticated firmware updates. However, if the ICS system is not connected to a Safety Instrumented System (SIS), safety mechanisms should be disabled.\n\nIn case of a disruption, there are preemptive shutdown operations that could be triggered, either intentionally by the attacker or unintentionally by the system due to safety shutdown procedures. If SIS redundant subsystems are disabled, a propagateRedundantShutdown operation might be required.\n\nProperty damage can occur if the system reaches an unsafe operating state, and this is possible if safety mechanisms fail to prevent damage during a shutdown. Loss of productivity and revenue can also occur due to disruptions and damage to the system.\n\nThis model also includes various propagate steps for critical and redundant subsystems, which are designed to spread the impacts of an attack across the system.
