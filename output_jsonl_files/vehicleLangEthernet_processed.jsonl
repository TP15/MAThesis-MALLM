It can either forward traffic or deny it, depending on its configuration. If a correctly configured firewall exists, it acts as a barrier against potential attacks, preventing unauthorized access. However, in cases where forwarding is enabled, vulnerabilities may lead to compromises, potentially affecting not only the router but also associated firewalls.\n\nIn such cases, an adversary might bypass the firewall and gain access to the network. This access can extend from the data link layer, where hosts with a MAC address on the network have Layer 2 access, to the network layer, where the possibility to submit IP packets over the network exists, but listening to others' traffic is still not feasible.\n\nEthernet networks, representing the IPv4 network when using homonym networks, are also a point of interest. Physical access allows bypassing port security, leading to the bypass of access control. Access to the data link layer may enable eavesdropping, depending on the network type, as well as ARP cache poisoning, potentially allowing an adversary to intercept and tamper with communications on the IP layer.\n\nIt's also essential to note that port security can be used to restrict a port's ingress traffic by limiting the MAC addresses that are allowed to send traffic into the port. Static ARP tables might also be exploited to cause ARP cache poisoning.\n\nIn summary, our focus should be on ensuring that firewalls are correctly configured, managing physical access to network devices, and monitoring traffic to detect and prevent ARP cache poisoning.
