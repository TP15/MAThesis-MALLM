{"instruction": "Write a Meta Attack Language snippet that declares a category containing these assets.", "input": "In the course of our network scrutiny, we've identified an asset of interest, the Data Historian, which is an integral part of the industrial control system (ICS) applications. This centralized database, residing within a computer stationed in the control system's demilitarized zone (DMZ), plays a crucial role in supporting external corporate user data access for archival and analysis purposes. It employs statistical process control and other techniques to manage the data it collects.\n\nThe Data Historian, being a key component, is developed by industry experts and is well-documented on the Mitre Collaboration platform (https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Data_Historian). In our analysis, we've observed that the Data Historian asset is not directly affected by attack steps such as manipulation of control or loss of control, as these actions are not relevant to its operation and function.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the Data Historian does interact with other assets within the system. For instance, it connects to the ICS Application, presumably to exchange data or commands. This relationship between the Data Historian and the ICS Application is crucial for the proper functioning of the control system, as the Data Historian relies on data from the ICS Application for its statistical analysis and archival purposes.\n\nIn the event of a potential threat, it would be prudent to monitor the interactions between the Data Historian and other assets, especially the ICS Application, to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data being exchanged. Additionally, it's important to keep the Data Historian's software updated and secured, as a vulnerable or outdated Data Historian could potentially expose the entire system to potential threats.", "output": "category IcsInterfaceResources{\n\n    asset DataHistorian extends IcsApplication \n        user info: \"A centralized database located on a computer installed in the control system DMZ supporting external corporate user data access for archival and analysis using statistical process control and other techniques.\"\n        developer info: \"https://collaborate.mitre.org/attackics/index.php/Data_Historian\"\n      {\n      // Override control related attack steps (Impact) because they are not relevant to this asset\n      | manipulationOfControl @Override\n\n      | lossOfControl @Override\n      }\n\n}"}
