These workstations are where the logic for our programmable controllers is developed, which are integral to both our industrial control processes and safety systems.\n\nNotably, the engineering workstations have a direct association with programmable controllers. When programming is initiated at the workstations, the logic developed there gets transferred to the controllers. This transfer of logic can potentially expose the system to risks if not properly secured.\n\nOn the other hand, the programming workstations also interact with user information, which is a sensitive asset in our system. The user data associated with these workstations could be a valuable target for an attacker seeking to gain unauthorized access to our system or manipulate the programming logic.\n\nIn summary, the engineering workstations, being the primary interfaces for programming our controllers, are vital components in our system.
