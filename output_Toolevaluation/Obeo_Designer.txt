 Requirement: HLR-1 – Functional Suitability: Support for Full MAL Workflow
Evaluation: 0.5
Justification: Obeo Designer, being a framework for creating custom modeling workbenches based on Sirius and EMF, does not offer out-of-the-box support for the full MAL workflow (creating `.mal` specs, instance models, running simulations, viewing results). However, it provides the foundational capabilities to build such support.
   `.mal` file creation/editing: Could be supported by integrating an Xtext-based editor for the MAL grammar, providing syntax highlighting, validation, and content assist. This requires specific development.
   Model Instance Definition: A custom graphical or tree-based editor could be created using Sirius to define system models conforming to a metamodel derived from a `.mal` specification. Importing/defining via YAML/JSON would likely require custom importers/parsers integrated into the Eclipse environment.
   Simulation Initiation/Viewing: Obeo Designer itself is not a simulator. It could be configured (e.g., via custom menu actions or buttons) to trigger external tools like the `malc` compiler and a subsequent simulation engine. Visualizing the simulation results (attack graphs) is a core strength, provided the results can be transformed into an EMF model instance that Sirius can render.
Therefore, it has the potential to support the workflow components through customization and integration, but lacks native, end-to-end support.

 Requirement: HLR-2 – Functional Suitability: Integration with MAL tools (e.g. compiler/simulator)
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Obeo Designer is built on the Eclipse platform, which is inherently designed for integration. It offers multiple mechanisms to integrate external tools:
   External Tool Launch Configurations: Standard Eclipse feature to run command-line tools like `malc` or a simulator.
   Java APIs: Custom plugins can be developed in Java to interact directly with MAL tools if they provide APIs, or to wrap command-line execution with more sophisticated logic (e.g., parsing output).
   Model Transformations: Can potentially transform models into formats required by MAL tools or process their output.
The framework is well-suited for acting as a central hub that orchestrates calls to external compilers and simulators, making integration highly feasible with development effort.

 Requirement: HLR-3 – Visualization: Graph-based features: zoom, abstraction, grouping, visual customization
Evaluation: 1
Justification: This is a core strength of Obeo Designer via the underlying Sirius platform. Sirius is specifically designed for creating rich graphical modeling editors.
   Graph-based features: Natively supports diagram representations with nodes and edges, essential for attack graphs. Standard features include zoom, pan, and potentially layout algorithms.
   Abstraction/Grouping: Supports layers, filters, and conditional display of elements, allowing users to manage complexity and view the graph at different levels of abstraction. Grouping elements visually is also possible.
   Visual Customization: Highly customizable appearance (colors, shapes, icons, line styles) based on model element properties (e.g., visualizing risk levels with colors, differentiating asset types with icons).
Sirius provides extensive control over the graphical representation, making it very suitable for visualizing complex MAL attack graphs.

 Requirement: HLR-4 – Pattern Reuse: Ability to define, reuse graph motifs and attack patterns
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Obeo Designer, through EMF and Sirius, strongly supports reusability:
   Metamodeling (EMF): The underlying structure (metamodel) derived from a `.mal` specification would define reusable concepts (Asset types, Attack Steps, Defenses). Instances of these concepts are used repeatedly in the system model.
   Graphical Palettes (Sirius): Custom modeling editors built with Sirius typically include palettes containing tools to create instances of the defined metamodel elements (e.g., drag-and-dropping predefined asset types or attack steps onto the diagram).
   Model Libraries/Imports: EMF allows models to reference elements defined in other models (libraries), facilitating the reuse of common system components or potentially predefined sub-graphs representing common patterns, although defining complex, reusable attack patterns as first-class graphical motifs might require more advanced configuration or custom tooling development beyond basic Sirius features.

 Requirement: HLR-5 – Documentation: Built-in guides, tutorials, and structured workflows
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Obeo Designer and the underlying Eclipse Sirius/EMF projects have extensive documentation, tutorials, and guides for using Obeo Designer/Sirius itself to build modeling tools. However, there is no specific documentation, guides, or tutorials for using it with MAL. A team would need to rely on the general Obeo/Sirius documentation to build the MAL-specific environment. While the platform documentation is good, it doesn't provide a pre-structured workflow for MAL, which would need to be designed and implemented.

 Requirement: HLR-6 – Usability: Intuitive GUI, drag-drop, dual (textual/graphical) views, syntax validation
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Assuming a well-configured MAL modeling environment is built using Obeo Designer:
   Intuitive GUI: Sirius allows the creation of standard, Eclipse-based graphical user interfaces with diagrams, palettes, property views, etc., which are generally intuitive for users familiar with modeling tools or IDEs.
   Drag-Drop: Palettes enabling drag-and-drop creation of model elements onto diagrams are a standard feature of Sirius-based editors.
   Dual Views: Obeo Designer can integrate graphical views (Sirius) with textual views (potentially using Xtext for `.mal` files or other textual syntaxes) and tree-based views (standard EMF feature). Synchronization between views is a key capability of the Eclipse Modeling ecosystem.
   Syntax Validation: If an Xtext editor is integrated for `.mal` files or custom textual model definitions, it provides robust, real-time syntax validation and error feedback. Sirius diagrams can also incorporate validation rules to provide visual feedback on modeling errors.

 Requirement: HLR-7 – Collaboration: Real-time multi-user collaboration and Git/VCS integration
Evaluation: 1
Justification:
   Git/VCS Integration: Being Eclipse-based, Obeo Designer benefits from excellent integration with version control systems like Git via the EGit plugin. Model files (XMI, YAML/JSON if used, `.mal`) can be versioned, compared, and merged (though model merging can sometimes be complex). This supports asynchronous collaboration well. Some further Obeo Designer versions support real-time collaboration.
   Real-time Collaboration: True real-time, simultaneous multi-user editing of the same diagram or model (like Google Docs) is not a standard feature of Obeo Designer or Sirius out-of-the-box. While some commercial or research Eclipse plugins for collaborative modeling exist, they are not part of the core offering. Obeo offers Obeo Designer Team which provides some model repository and locking features, but typically not fine-grained real-time co-editing of diagrams.

 Requirement: HLR-8 – Compatibility: Support for import/export in MAL-compatible formats
Evaluation: 0.5
Justification: Obeo Designer itself doesn't inherently understand MAL-specific formats (.mal language spec, specific YAML/JSON structures for models, attack graph formats). However, the underlying Eclipse platform and modeling frameworks (EMF, M2T Acceleo for code/text generation) provide powerful mechanisms to build importers and exporters.
   Import: Custom parsers (e.g., using Java, Xtext) can be developed to read `.mal` files or YAML/JSON instance models and populate an internal EMF model representation.
   Export: Model-to-text transformations (e.g., using Acceleo) or custom Java code can generate various outputs from the internal models, such as configuration files for simulators or reports.
Compatibility is achievable through development effort but is not provided natively. The score reflects the potential combined with the required effort.

 Requirement: HLR-9 – Maintainability: Open-source, community-driven, sustainable development model
Evaluation: 0
Justification: Obeo Designer's core components are based on well-established open-source projects within the Eclipse Foundation. But the main advantages are owned by Obeo.

 Requirement: HLR-10 – Performance: Handles large models and complex graphs without UI or system degradation
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Sirius is designed to handle industrial-scale models and diagrams. Performance generally depends on:
   Model Size: EMF itself is quite efficient with large models.
   Diagram Complexity: The number of graphical elements, conditional styles, and active validation rules in a specific diagram can impact UI responsiveness. Sirius includes optimizations like lazy loading and element caching.
   Specific Configuration: How the modeling environment is configured heavily influences performance.
While capable of handling large models, extremely complex attack graphs (e.g., tens of thousands of nodes/edges displayed simultaneously with complex styling) could potentially lead to UI sluggishness, as with most graphical modeling tools. It generally performs well for typical large modeling tasks but may require careful configuration and potentially diagram simplification strategies (layers, filters) for very large MAL graphs. No specific benchmarks for MAL graphs were found, so this is based on general Sirius capabilities.

 Requirement: HLR-11 – Portability: Cross-platform or web-based ease of use, low barrier to installation
Evaluation: 0.5
Justification:
   Cross-Platform: As an Eclipse-based Rich Client Platform (RCP) application, Obeo Designer runs on major desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) where a compatible Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is available.
   Web-Based: It is primarily a desktop application, not web-based. While technologies exist to provide web-based access to Eclipse/Sirius applications (e.g., Eclipse Theia, Sirius Web), this is not the standard Obeo Designer offering and requires significant additional setup/architecture.
   Installation: Installation involves downloading the application package and ensuring Java is installed. It's a standard desktop software installation process, which might be a barrier in environments favouring zero-install web tools, but straightforward for technical users.

 Requirement: HLR-12 – Security: Options for local/on-premise data storage for secure environments
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Obeo Designer is a desktop application. By default, all models, configurations, and generated files (.mal specs, instance models, potentially graph results if imported) are stored on the local filesystem where the tool is run. This makes it inherently suitable for secure, on-premise environments where data residency and control are critical, as no cloud storage or external connections are required for its core modeling functions (unless integrations are specifically built to use them).

🔚 Optional Final Summary

   Overall Suitability for MAL: Obeo Designer is not an out-of-the-box MAL solution but offers significant potential as a platform to build a tailored MAL modeling and visualization environment. Its suitability depends heavily on the availability of resources and expertise (Eclipse, EMF, Sirius, potentially Xtext, Java) to develop the necessary MAL-specific components (parsers, editors, integrations, visualizers).
   Notable Strengths:
       Highly customizable and powerful graphical visualization capabilities (via Sirius).
       Strong foundation for defining and working with DSLs (via EMF, potentially Xtext).
       Excellent integration capabilities within the Eclipse ecosystem for connecting external tools (`malc`, simulators).
       Open-source core, ensuring maintainability and transparency.
       Suitable for secure, on-premise deployment.
   Notable Weaknesses:
       Requires significant development effort to support the MAL workflow; no native MAL features.
       Steep learning curve for developers customizing the environment (EMF/Sirius).
       Primarily a desktop tool, lacking native web access or built-in real-time collaboration.
       Performance with extremely large/complex attack graphs needs validation.
   Standalone vs. Enabler: Obeo Designer functions best as an enabler within a larger MAL toolchain. It can provide a sophisticated, integrated front-end for defining system models, triggering external MAL compilers/simulators, and visualizing the resulting attack graphs, but it relies on other tools for the core MAL processing logic.
