Okay, here is the evaluation of Kermeta 2 (EMF-Based) based on the provided criteria and research into its capabilities, focusing on its potential to support the MAL workflow.

---

 Requirement: HLR-1 – Functional Suitability: Support for Full MAL Workflow

Evaluation: 0.5 / 1

Justification: Kermeta, being an EMF-based metamodeling and execution environment, provides strong foundations but doesn't offer out-of-the-box support for the entire MAL workflow.
   Creation/editing of .mal files: Kermeta, especially when combined with Xtext (a common pairing in the Eclipse ecosystem), is highly suitable for defining the MAL language itself (as a DSL) and creating sophisticated textual editors with syntax highlighting, validation, and code completion. This is a strong potential fit.
   Definition of system models (YAML/JSON): While EMF primarily uses XMI for model persistence, Kermeta's model transformation capabilities could be used to create importers/exporters for YAML or JSON formats. This requires development effort but is feasible.
   Attacker profiles: These can be defined as part of the system model or as separate models within the EMF/Kermeta framework.
   Compilation and simulation initiation/viewing: Kermeta itself is not the `malc` compiler or simulator. It could potentially initiate `malc` as an external process. Viewing simulation results (attack graphs) would require parsing `malc`'s output and visualizing it, likely using frameworks like Sirius (see HLR-3).
   Conclusion: Kermeta provides strong building blocks for parts of the workflow (language definition, modeling) but requires significant integration and development effort to support the full cycle, especially interfacing with external MAL tools and handling specific I/O formats.

 Requirement: HLR-2 – Functional Suitability: Integration with MAL tools (e.g. compiler/simulator)

Evaluation: 1 / 1

Justification: Kermeta runs within the Eclipse/Java environment. This environment provides standard mechanisms for:
   Executing external command-line tools (like `malc`).
   Reading and writing files in various formats (required for passing models to `malc` and reading results).
   Parsing complex data structures (like attack graphs, assuming a defined output format from `malc`).
Therefore, the technical capability to integrate with external tools like the MAL compiler/simulator is fully present, although it requires custom implementation within the Kermeta/Eclipse environment.

 Requirement: HLR-3 – Visualization: Graph-based features: zoom, abstraction, grouping, visual customization

Evaluation: 1 / 1

Justification: Kermeta itself is not primarily a visualization tool, but it integrates tightly with the Eclipse Modeling ecosystem, particularly with Eclipse Sirius. Sirius is specifically designed for creating custom graphical modeling workbenches based on EMF models. Sirius provides:
   Highly customizable graphical representations (nodes, edges, icons, colors).
   Support for various layout algorithms.
   Features like zoom, layers, filters, element grouping, and potentially different levels of abstraction (if configured).
Assuming the attack graphs generated by `malc` can be parsed into an EMF model, Sirius (integrated with Kermeta) offers powerful, customizable graph visualization capabilities suitable for MAL attack paths.

 Requirement: HLR-4 – Pattern Reuse: Ability to define, reuse graph motifs and attack patterns

Evaluation: 1 / 1

Justification: Kermeta's foundation in EMF and metamodeling excels at defining reusable concepts.
   The MAL language definition itself (.mal file) defines reusable assets, attack steps, and defenses (patterns). Kermeta can model this language structure.
   Within system models, users can instantiate these defined assets and steps repeatedly.
   EMF supports the concept of model libraries and reusable model fragments. Specific, common attack patterns or security configurations could be defined as reusable model snippets or sub-models.
Kermeta's core purpose as a metamodeling tool directly supports the definition and reuse of patterns as specified in a DSL like MAL.

 Requirement: HLR-5 – Documentation: Built-in guides, tutorials, and structured workflows

Evaluation: 0.5 / 1

Justification: The Kermeta website provides documentation, tutorials, and examples related to metamodeling, DSL creation, execution semantics, and potentially integration with tools like Sirius or Xtext. However, this documentation is general to Kermeta and MDE principles. There is no specific documentation, built-in guides, or structured workflows tailored to the MAL language or cybersecurity threat modeling use cases. Users would need to adapt the general Kermeta knowledge to the specific MAL domain.

 Requirement: HLR-6 – Usability: Intuitive GUI, drag-drop, dual (textual/graphical) views, syntax validation

Evaluation: 1 / 1

Justification: Leveraging the Eclipse platform and associated modeling tools, Kermeta can offer high usability if properly configured:
   GUI: Runs within the Eclipse IDE, providing a familiar (though potentially complex) graphical interface.
   Drag-Drop: Possible when using graphical editors built with frameworks like Sirius.
   Dual Views: A common pattern in Eclipse MDE is to combine textual editing (e.g., with Xtext) and graphical viewing/editing (e.g., with Sirius), potentially synchronized. This is achievable.
   Syntax Validation: Excellent support for real-time syntax validation, error checking, and code completion if a MAL editor is developed using Xtext.
The potential for a highly usable environment integrating textual and graphical views with robust validation is high, relying on established Eclipse technologies often used with Kermeta.

 Requirement: HLR-7 – Collaboration: Real-time multi-user collaboration and Git/VCS integration

Evaluation: 0.5 / 1

Justification:
   Real-time multi-user collaboration: This is generally not a built-in feature of standard Kermeta/Eclipse setups. While some specialized Eclipse plugins for collaborative modeling exist (e.g., ECF), they are not standard parts of Kermeta and may require significant setup or have limitations.
   Git/VCS Integration: Excellent. Eclipse has mature integration with Git and other version control systems. Model files (XMI), language specifications (.mal if defined textually), and configuration files can all be versioned effectively. EMF Compare tools can assist with model differencing and merging, although complex merges can still be challenging.
   Conclusion: Strong support for asynchronous collaboration via VCS, but lacks native real-time multi-user features.

 Requirement: HLR-8 – Compatibility: Support for import/export in MAL-compatible formats

Evaluation: 0.5 / 1

Justification: Kermeta/EMF primarily uses XMI (XML Metadata Interchange) for model serialization. MAL involves specific formats: `.mal` for language specs, potentially YAML/JSON for system models, and specific formats for attack graphs.
   Kermeta does not natively import/export these MAL-specific formats.
   However, Kermeta includes powerful model transformation capabilities (e.g., using ETL - Epsilon Transformation Language, or potentially Kermeta's own action language). These capabilities can be used to build importers and exporters for arbitrary text or model formats, including YAML, JSON, or custom graph formats used by `malc`.
   Conclusion: Compatibility requires development effort to build the necessary transformations/parsers/serializers. The capability to achieve compatibility is present, but it's not an out-of-the-box feature.

 Requirement: HLR-9 – Maintainability: Open-source, community-driven, sustainable development model

Evaluation: 1 / 1

Justification: Kermeta is an open-source project, typically under the Eclipse Public License (EPL), hosted as part of the Eclipse ecosystem or related academic/research initiatives (e.g., INRIA/IRISA). It benefits from the large Eclipse community and established practices for open-source development. While activity levels may fluctuate as with many academic/research projects, its open-source nature and foundation on the widely used EMF framework contribute positively to its potential long-term maintainability and adaptability.

 Requirement: HLR-10 – Performance: Handles large models and complex graphs without UI or system degradation

Evaluation: 0.5 / 1

Justification: Performance depends heavily on the specific use case and the underlying Eclipse components.
   EMF: Generally performs well for moderately large models. Very large models (millions of elements) can strain memory and processing.
   Kermeta Execution: Performance depends on the complexity of the defined operational semantics.
   Visualization (Sirius): Graphical editors can become slow and resource-intensive when displaying very large or complex graphs with many elements and relationships. Performance often depends on the rendering strategy, layout algorithms, and the level of detail displayed.
   Conclusion: Kermeta/EMF can handle reasonably large models, but performance with extremely large MAL system models or highly complex, dense attack graphs (especially in graphical views) could be a concern and may require careful optimization or abstraction techniques within the visualization setup. No specific benchmarks for MAL use cases were found.

 Requirement: HLR-11 – Portability: Cross-platform or web-based ease of use, low barrier to installation

Evaluation: 0.5 / 1

Justification:
   Cross-Platform: Yes. Being based on Java and Eclipse, Kermeta runs on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
   Web-Based: No. Kermeta is primarily a desktop-based toolset running within the Eclipse IDE.
   Ease of Use/Installation: Requires installing a Java Development Kit (JDK) and the Eclipse IDE, followed by installing the Kermeta plugins/features. This represents a moderate barrier to entry, particularly for users unfamiliar with the Eclipse ecosystem. It's not a simple standalone application or web tool.

 Requirement: HLR-12 – Security: Options for local/on-premise data storage for secure environments

Evaluation: 1 / 1

Justification: Kermeta, as an Eclipse-based desktop tool, operates entirely locally by default. All data (language specifications, models, configurations) is stored on the user's local filesystem or designated network drives. It does not inherently require cloud connectivity or external data storage, making it suitable for secure, on-premise, or air-gapped environments where data confidentiality is paramount.

🔚 Optional Final Summary

   Overall Suitability: Kermeta 2 presents a strong potential as an enabling platform for parts of the MAL workflow, particularly for defining the MAL language itself (using Xtext) and for visualizing attack graphs (using Sirius). However, it is not a standalone, out-of-the-box solution for the entire MAL lifecycle. Significant development and integration effort would be required to bridge the gaps, especially regarding interaction with the `malc` compiler/simulator and handling specific MAL file formats (like YAML/JSON model instances natively).
   Notable Strengths:
       Leverages the powerful, mature, and extensible Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF).
       Excellent potential for creating sophisticated textual editors for `.mal` files (via Xtext).
       Strong, customizable graph visualization capabilities (via Sirius).
       Open-source and runs locally, suitable for secure environments.
       Good VCS integration for model management.
   Notable Weaknesses:
       Requires significant custom development for full MAL workflow integration (interfacing with `malc`, I/O format handling).
       No native support for MAL-specific concepts or tools.
       Potential performance bottlenecks with very large models/graphs, especially in visualization.
       Installation and learning curve associated with the Eclipse IDE and MDE concepts.
       Lacks native real-time collaboration features.
   Conclusion: Kermeta 2 functions best as an enabler within a larger, custom-built toolchain for MAL analysis. It could provide the core framework for building sophisticated MAL modeling environments and visualizers but needs to be integrated with MAL-specific compilers, simulators, and potentially custom data parsers/serializers.
