ƒ Requirement: HLR-1 – Functional Suitability: Support for Full MAL Workflow
Evaluation: 1
Justification: JetBrains MPS is a language workbench specifically designed for creating Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs).
   Creation/editing of .mal files: MPS is exceptionally well-suited for this. It allows defining the abstract syntax, concrete syntax (textual, graphical, tabular), type system, and constraints for a language like MAL. This would provide a structured, syntax-aware editor for `.mal` specifications, going beyond simple text editing.
   Definition of system models: MPS can be used to define a dedicated language for system modeling, potentially offering textual, tabular, or even graphical notations superior to raw YAML/JSON editing for this specific domain. Alternatively, its generator framework could process models defined externally (e.g., YAML/JSON parsed by custom code integrated into MPS).
   Simulation initiation/viewing: MPS allows defining "intentions" and actions within the IDE. These actions can trigger external tools, such as the `malc` compiler/simulator, passing the necessary model files. Results could potentially be parsed and displayed back within the MPS environment, possibly leveraging its visualization capabilities (see HLR-3), although this requires implementation effort.
Overall, MPS provides the foundational capabilities to build tools supporting the entire MAL workflow, though significant development effort is required to implement the MAL-specific logic and integrations.

 Requirement: HLR-2 – Functional Integration with MAL tools (e.g. compiler/simulator)
Evaluation: 1
Justification: Integration with external tools is a core capability of MPS. Its "Generator" component can produce text files in any format (e.g., input files for `malc`). Furthermore, MPS allows defining custom actions ("Intentions," build scripts) that can execute command-line tools like `malc`, capture their output, and potentially process it. This makes direct integration with the existing MAL compiler/simulator toolchain highly feasible.

 Requirement: HLR-3 – Visualization: Graph-based features: zoom, abstraction, grouping, visual customization
Evaluation: 1
Justification: MPS supports the creation of graphical notations for DSLs. This means one could build a graphical editor/viewer for MAL attack graphs within MPS. Basic features like displaying nodes/edges and potentially zoom/pan are achievable using MPS's graphical editor framework. However, advanced graph visualization features like sophisticated automatic layout algorithms, semantic zooming, interactive abstraction/collapsing of subgraphs, complex grouping, and highly tailored visual customization are not provided out-of-the-box. Implementing these advanced features would require significant effort, possibly integrating external Java graph visualization libraries (like JGraphT, Prefuse, etc.) within the MPS editor definition. MPS provides the framework to build such visualizations, but not the ready-made advanced graph analysis components.

 Requirement: HLR-4 – Pattern Reuse: Ability to define, reuse graph motifs and attack patterns
Evaluation: 1
Justification: As a language workbench, MPS excels at defining reusable language constructs. One could define concepts corresponding to MAL assets, attack steps, and associations as core language elements. Higher-level constructs representing common attack patterns or reusable security motifs could then be defined within the MAL language definition built using MPS. These patterns could be instantiated within system models, promoting consistency and reuse. This is a primary strength of using a DSL approach with a tool like MPS.

 Requirement: HLR-5 – Documentation: Built-in guides, tutorials, and structured workflows
Evaluation: 1
Justification: JetBrains MPS itself has extensive documentation, tutorials, cookbooks, and examples for learning and using MPS to build languages. However, it obviously contains no built-in guides or structured workflows specific to MAL. A development team using MPS would leverage MPS's documentation to build the MAL tooling, including potentially creating help sections or guided workflows for the end-users of the MAL tools they create. The score reflects that MPS provides excellent developer documentation but requires effort to create end-user MAL-specific guidance within the resulting tool.

 Requirement: HLR-6 – Usability: Intuitive GUI, drag-drop, dual (textual/graphical) views, syntax validation
Evaluation: 1
Justification:
   Intuitive GUI: MPS is based on the IntelliJ platform, known for powerful but complex interfaces. While feature-rich, it has a steep learning curve. However, the resulting editors created with MPS can be tailored for specific user needs.
   Drag-Drop: Possible to implement within custom graphical editors built using MPS.
   Dual Views: This is a core strength of MPS's projectional editing. A single underlying abstract model can have multiple synchronized representations (e.g., textual MAL code, graphical attack graph view, tabular asset list).
   Syntax Validation: Fundamental to MPS. Editors built with MPS are inherently structure-aware and provide real-time validation based on the defined language rules (syntax, types, constraints), preventing syntactically incorrect models.

 Requirement: HLR-7 – Collaboration: Real-time multi-user collaboration and Git/VCS integration
Evaluation: 0.5
Justification: MPS offers excellent integration with Version Control Systems like Git, leveraging the robust VCS features of the IntelliJ platform. This supports asynchronous collaboration through standard commit/merge workflows. MPS model files (typically XML-based) can be versioned, although merging complex model changes can sometimes be challenging. However, MPS does not natively support real-time, simultaneous multi-user editing of the same model in the style of Google Docs. Collaboration relies primarily on VCS.

 Requirement: HLR-8 – Compatibility: Support for import/export in MAL-compatible formats
Evaluation: 0.5
Justification:
   Export: MPS's generator framework is highly flexible and can be configured to output text in virtually any format. Generating files required by the `malc` compiler or exporting attack graphs to standard formats (e.g., GraphML, JSON) is definitely achievable with development effort.
   Import: Importing data from existing formats (like YAML/JSON system models, or potentially parsing existing `.mal` files if not created within MPS) requires building custom importer logic within MPS. This is feasible but not an out-of-the-box feature.
MPS provides the capability to build importers/exporters, but they need to be explicitly developed.

 Requirement: HLR-9 – Maintainability: Open-source, community-driven, sustainable development model
Evaluation: 1
Justification: JetBrains MPS is open-source under the Apache 2.0 license. It is actively developed and maintained by JetBrains, a major software company, and has an active user community, forums, and issue tracker. This suggests a sustainable development model and good prospects for long-term maintainability and support.

 Requirement: HLR-10 – Performance: Handles large models and complex graphs without UI or system degradation
Evaluation: 1
Justification: MPS is a complex IDE built on the IntelliJ platform. Its performance generally depends heavily on the complexity of the language definition (e.g., number of constraints, type system rules, editor complexity) and the size of the models being edited. While capable for many DSLs, users have reported performance degradation with very large models or highly complex language definitions, especially involving graphical editors or intensive background computations. Evaluating its suitability for potentially massive attack graphs generated by MAL would require specific benchmarking with a prototype MAL language implementation in MPS. It's capable, but performance with extremely large graphs may require careful optimization during language/editor development.

 Requirement: HLR-11 – Portability: Cross-platform or web-based ease of use, low barrier to installation
Evaluation: 1
Justification: MPS is a desktop application built on Java. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, providing good cross-platform support. However, it is not web-based. Installation involves downloading the IDE and ensuring a compatible Java Runtime Environment is present. The barrier to entry is typical for a professional desktop IDE – higher than a simple web tool but standard for development environments.

 Requirement: HLR-12 – Security: Options for local/on-premise data storage for secure environments
Evaluation: 1
Justification: As a desktop application, MPS works entirely with local files. Language definitions, models, and generated code are all stored on the user's machine or network drives. It does not inherently require cloud connectivity for its core functions (language definition, editing, generation). This makes it suitable for secure environments where data must remain on-premise.

 Optional Final Summary

   Overall suitability for use with MAL: JetBrains MPS shows high potential as a platform or workbench for developing sophisticated tooling for the Meta Attack Language (MAL) workflow. It is not an out-of-the-box MAL solution but provides the necessary building blocks.
   Notable strengths:
       Strong DSL definition capabilities (syntax, typesystem, constraints).
       Projectional editing allowing multiple synchronized views (textual, graphical).
       Excellent integration capabilities for external tools like `malc`.
       Code generation flexibility for exporting data/models.
       Open-source, cross-platform, and supports local/on-premise operation.
   Notable weaknesses:
       Requires significant development effort and expertise in MPS itself to implement MAL support.
       Steep learning curve for developers building the MAL language/tools.
       Advanced graph visualization features require custom implementation/integration.
       Potential performance concerns for extremely large models/graphs need investigation.
       Lacks native real-time collaboration features.
   Standalone vs. Enabler: MPS functions best as an enabler within a larger toolchain or as a workbench to create a dedicated, custom MAL environment. It would require substantial investment to build a full-featured, standalone MAL solution using MPS, but the resulting tool could be very powerful and tailored specifically to the MAL workflow.
