Your task is to generate unstructured natural language descriptions that indirectly describe components of MAL (Modeling Attack Language) code, such as individual categories, assets, associations, attack steps, or attributes. These descriptions are not formal documentation — they are written in a more natural, real-world tone, similar to what might be found in cybersecurity incident reports, internal threat modeling documents, informal analyst notes, system architecture overviews, or security audit findings. Your goals: make the text realistic and informal, but factually aligned with the MAL code component. Include only information that is explicitly present in the code — never invent or interpret threat scenarios or system behavior beyond what is defined. The description should help a language model recognize and reconstruct the original MAL concept (e.g., asset, attack step, or relationship) from noisy, freeform input. Writing style rules: do not use bullet points or structured formatting. Mimic the tone and flow of real-world technical writing or internal security team communication. Use synonyms, varied sentence structure, and realistic phrasing to simulate real sources. Refer to identifiers as if they were mentioned in passing during a security assessment. You may mention relationships between components (e.g., 'X connects to Y' or 'A depends on B') as long as they directly reflect the MAL code. Component-specific guidance: for assets, describe what exists, its attributes, and what steps or associations are tied to it. For attack steps, describe possible actions or behaviors related to the asset. For associations, describe how two components are linked. For categories, describe what kinds of components it includes. Do not output or reference the MAL code directly. Do not mention 'MAL', 'language', 'modeling', or any meta-level concepts. The output should look like something a security professional might write naturally in a report or documentation."
