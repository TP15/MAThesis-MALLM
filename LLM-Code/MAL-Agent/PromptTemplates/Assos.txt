**Objective:** Define the associations (relationships) between the assets identified in Prompt 1.

**Prerequisites:** You should have already defined your Assets from Prompt 1.

**Your Task:**
For each logical relationship that can exist between any two (or sometimes the same) assets, define an association. Associations dictate how instances of assets can be connected in a model, which is crucial for defining how attacks can propagate between assets.

For each association, provide:
   - **Name:** A descriptive name for the association (e.g., `NetworkConnection`, `DataStorage`, `ExecutionEnvironment`).
   - **First Asset & Role:**
     * **Asset Name:** The name of the first asset in the association.
     * **Role Name:** How the first asset participates in this association (e.g., `connectedTo`, `stores`, `runsOn`). This role name is used when traversing the model.
     * **Cardinality:** The number of instances of the first asset that can participate in one instance of this association (e.g., `1`, `*` (zero or more), `1..*` (one or more), `0..1` (zero or one)). The example language uses `1` and `*` (interpreted as non-zero in that context).
   - **Second Asset & Role:**
     * **Asset Name:** The name of the second asset in the association.
     * **Role Name:** How the second asset participates in this association (e.g., `hostsConnection`, `isStoredOn`, `executes`).
     * **Cardinality:** The number of instances of the second asset that can participate in one instance of this association.

**Output Format Example:**

Associations:
  - Name: `Execution`
    First Asset: `Machine`
    Role Name: `executor`
    Cardinality: `1`
    Second Asset: `Software`
    Role Name: `executees`
    Cardinality: `*`
    Description: (Optional) A Machine executes one or more Software instances.
  - Name: `Communication`
    First Asset: `Machine`
    Role Name: `parties`
    Cardinality: `*`
    Second Asset: `Network`
    Role Name: `networks` (though the example uses `parties` for Machine and `networks` for Network, often roles are distinct)
    Cardinality: `*`
    Description: (Optional) Machines communicate over Networks.
  - Name: `Storage`
    First Asset: `Machine`
    Role Name: `stores`
    Cardinality: `*`
    Second Asset: `Credentials`
    Role Name: `storedCreds`
    Cardinality: `*`
    Description: (Optional) A Machine stores Credentials.

**Contextual Information (Optional - For RAG):**
* [Provide data models, architectural diagrams, or system documentation for your target domain that illustrate how components are interconnected.]
* *Refer to "1-s2.0-S0167404823001943-main.pdf" for the formal definition of Associations, Roles, and Multiplicities (Cardinalities). The example associations are clearly defined at the end of the example language specification.*
* *"Towards a Systematic Method for Developing Meta Attack Language Instances (1).pdf" also describes associations as a core part of the MAL metamodel.*

**Best Practices to Consider:**
* **Bidirectional Understanding:** While defining, think about the relationship from both assets' perspectives.
* **Naming Conventions:** Use consistent and clear naming for associations and roles.
* **Correct Cardinalities:** Ensure cardinalities accurately reflect the real-world constraints of your domain.
* **Impact on Attack Paths:** Consider how these associations will enable or constrain the propagation of attack steps between asset instances.
