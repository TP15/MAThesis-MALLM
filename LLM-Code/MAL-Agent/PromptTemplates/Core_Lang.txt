**Objective:** Define the foundational elements for a new Meta Attack Language (MAL).

**Your Task:**
Based on the domain you are modeling, please provide the following information:

**0. MAL Language Name:**
   - Propose a concise and descriptive name for this new MAL.
     * *Consider the specific domain this MAL will target (e.g., "CloudServiceMAL," "IndustrialControlSystemMAL").*

**1. Identify All Assets:**
   - List all the essential components, entities, or elements within your target domain that can be involved in or affected by an attack. These are your 'Assets'.
   - For each asset, provide:
     * **Name:** A clear and unique name for the asset.
     * **Description:** A brief explanation of what the asset represents in your domain.
     * **(Optional) Abstract/Concrete:** Specify if the asset is abstract (a general category that won't be directly instantiated but extended by other assets) or concrete (can be directly instantiated in a model).
     * **(Optional) Parent Asset:** If this asset inherits properties from another (abstract) asset, specify the parent asset's name.

**3. Group Assets into Categories:**
   - Organize the identified assets into logical 'Categories'. Categories help in structuring the language and improving its understandability.
   - For each category, provide:
     * **Category Name:** A descriptive name for the group of assets.
     * **Contained Assets:** List the names of the assets that belong to this category.

**Output Format Example:**

MAL Language Name: [Your MAL Name Here]

Categories:
  - Category Name: [e.g., NetworkInfrastructure]
    Assets:
      - Asset:
          Name: [e.g., Router]
          Description: [e.g., A device that forwards data packets between computer networks.]
          Abstract/Concrete: Concrete
          Parent Asset: (Optional) [e.g., NetworkDevice]
      - Asset:
          Name: [e.g., Firewall]
          Description: [e.g., A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic.]
          Abstract/Concrete: Concrete
          Parent Asset: (Optional) [e.g., SecurityAppliance]
  - Category Name: [e.g., EndUserDevices]
    Assets:
      - Asset:
          Name: [e.g., Workstation]
          Description: [e.g., A personal computer used by an end-user.]
          Abstract/Concrete: Concrete
          Parent Asset: (Optional) [e.g., ComputingDevice]

**Contextual Information (Optional - For RAG):**
* [If you have domain-specific documents, standards (e.g., IEC 61850 for power systems), or existing threat models, you can reference them here or provide their content to aid the generation process.]
* *Refer to the provided documents "Towards a Systematic Method for Developing Meta Attack Language Instances (1).pdf" and "1-s2.0-S0167404823001943-main.pdf" for general MAL concepts like Assets, Categories, and Inheritance.*

**Best Practices to Consider:**
* **Clarity and Precision:** Use clear, unambiguous names and descriptions.
* **Domain Relevance:** Ensure all assets and categories accurately reflect the target domain.
* **Granularity:** Decide on an appropriate level of detail for your assets. You can start more general and refine later.
* **Reusability:** Think about how assets might be reused or extended. Abstract assets are good for this.
