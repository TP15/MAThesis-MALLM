{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis MAL code defines a category named `ComputeResources` that models various assets and their associated components, attack steps, defenses, and relationships in a cybersecurity threat modeling context. The assets defined in this category include `Hardware`, `SoftwareProduct`, `Application`, `IDPS`, and `PhysicalZone`.\n\n1. **Hardware**: Specifies the hardware on which applications can run. It includes various attack steps such as `attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, `attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, and `physicalAccess`. These attack steps can be used to exploit hardware vulnerabilities, spread malware, or gain physical access to the hardware. Defenses such as `hardwareModificationsProtection` are also defined to protect against unauthorized modifications to the hardware.\n\n2. **SoftwareProduct**: Represents a software package that certain applications are using, which can be associated with specific vulnerabilities or compromised during a software supply chain attack. Attack steps such as `compromiseApplications`, `readApplications`, `modifyApplications`, and `denyApplications` are defined to exploit the vulnerabilities associated with the software product, while defenses such as `notPresent` can be used to model the possibility that the software product does not exist.\n\n3. **Application**: Models any type of software process or component, from firmware and operating systems to plugins and sessions. It includes various attack steps such as `useVulnerability`, `attemptReverseReach`, `localConnect`, and `networkConnect`, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities, gain access to networks and connections, or authenticate with the application. Defenses such as `notPresent` can also be used to model the possibility that the application does not exist.\n\n4. **IDPS**: Represents an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) that is tasked with protecting other applications from malicious activity. It includes the defense `effectiveness`, which represents how capable the IDPS is to prevent disruptions from occurring on the associated applications, and the defense `effectivenessBypassed`, which represents when the protection of the IDPS has been bypassed.\n\n5. **PhysicalZone**: Represents the location where hardware systems and networks are physically deployed. It includes the attack step `gainPhysicalAccess`, which can be used to gain physical access to the housed hardware and networks.\n\nThe associations section defines the relationships between the assets. For example, an application can be hosted on hardware, protected by an IDPS, associated with a software product, and deployed in a physical zone. Access on a physical zone provides physical access to the deployed hardware and networks, but access to the hardware or network does not provide access to the physical zone.\n\nMAL Code:\n#id: \"org.mal_lang.ConputerResourceslang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

The assets defined in this category include `Hardware`, `SoftwareProduct`, `Application`, `IDPS`, and `PhysicalZone`.\n\n1. **Hardware**: Specifies the hardware on which applications can run. It includes various attack steps such as `attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, `attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, and `physicalAccess`. These attack steps can be used to exploit hardware vulnerabilities, spread malware, or gain physical access to the hardware. Defenses such as `hardwareModificationsProtection` are also defined to protect against unauthorized modifications to the hardware.\n\n2. **SoftwareProduct**: Represents a software package that certain applications are using, which can be associated with specific vulnerabilities or compromised during a software supply chain attack. Attack steps such as `compromiseApplications`, `readApplications`, `modifyApplications`, and `denyApplications` are defined to exploit the vulnerabilities associated with the software product, while defenses such as `notPresent` can be used to model the possibility that the software product does not exist.\n\n3. **Application**: Models any type of software process or component, from firmware and operating systems to plugins and sessions. It includes various attack steps such as `useVulnerability`, `attemptReverseReach`, `localConnect`, and `networkConnect`, which can be used to exploit vulnerabilities, gain access to networks and connections, or authenticate with the application. Defenses such as `notPresent` can also be used to model the possibility that the application does not exist.\n\n4. **IDPS**: Represents an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) that is tasked with protecting other applications from malicious activity. It includes the defense `effectiveness`, which represents how capable the IDPS is to prevent disruptions from occurring on the associated applications, and the defense `effectivenessBypassed`, which represents when the protection of the IDPS has been bypassed.\n\n5. **PhysicalZone**: Represents the location where hardware systems and networks are physically deployed. It includes the attack step `gainPhysicalAccess`, which can be used to gain physical access to the housed hardware and networks.\n\nThe associations section defines the relationships between the assets. For example, an application can be hosted on hardware, protected by an IDPS, associated with a software product, and deployed in a physical zone. Access on a physical zone provides physical access to the deployed hardware and networks, but access to the hardware or network does not provide access to the physical zone.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ConputerResourceslang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nCategory: ComputeResources\n\nThe provided MAL code defines a domain-specific threat modeling language for cybersecurity, focusing on assets related to compute resources. The main assets in this model are Hardware, SoftwareProduct, Application, and IDPS (Intrusion Detection and Prevention System).\n\n1. Hardware: Represents the physical hardware on which applications run. It models attacks such as physical access, supply chain compromises, and hardware modifications. The hardware can also be affected by malware spread through removable media.\n\n2. SoftwareProduct: Represents a specific software package or version that certain applications use. It is associated with vulnerabilities or compromised deployment repositories in a software supply chain attack.\n\n3. Application: Represents any type of software process or component, such as firmware, operating systems, plugins, sessions, etc. It has various attack steps related to using vulnerabilities, network connectivity, local connectivity, and unsafe user activities.\n\n4. IDPS: An IDPS is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System designed to protect other applications from malicious activities like exploiting vulnerabilities or unsafe user actions.\n\nThe model also includes various components, such as vulnerabilities, defenses (e.g., hardware modifications protection, supply chain auditing), and associations (e.g., connections between applications, software products, and networks).\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements are defined through various attack steps, which are used to model the propagation of attacks, defenses, and the impact of different actions on the assets.\n\nThe domain-specific implications of this MAL code lie in its focus on hardware, software, applications, and IDPS systems, making it suitable for analyzing threats related to these areas. The use of attack steps allows for a more detailed and structured representation of threat scenarios.\n\nThe code is written in a plain, professional language suitable for a technical audience, avoiding unnecessary repetition or vague summaries. It provides exhaustive and concise explanations of the purpose, function, and components of the MAL code.\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

Hardware: Represents the physical hardware on which applications run. It models attacks such as physical access, supply chain compromises, and hardware modifications. The hardware can also be affected by malware spread through removable media.\n\n2. SoftwareProduct: Represents a specific software package or version that certain applications use. It is associated with vulnerabilities or compromised deployment repositories in a software supply chain attack.\n\n3. Application: Represents any type of software process or component, such as firmware, operating systems, plugins, sessions, etc. It has various attack steps related to using vulnerabilities, network connectivity, local connectivity, and unsafe user activities.\n\n4. IDPS: An IDPS is an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System designed to protect other applications from malicious activities like exploiting vulnerabilities or unsafe user actions.\n\nThe model also includes various components, such as vulnerabilities, defenses (e.g., hardware modifications protection, supply chain auditing), and associations (e.g., connections between applications, software products, and networks).\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements are defined through various attack steps, which are used to model the propagation of attacks, defenses, and the impact of different actions on the assets.\n\nThe domain-specific implications of this MAL code lie in its focus on hardware, software, applications, and IDPS systems, making it suitable for analyzing threats related to these areas. The use of attack steps allows for a more detailed and structured representation of threat scenarios.\n\nThe code is written in a plain, professional language suitable for a technical audience, avoiding unnecessary repetition or vague summaries. It provides exhaustive and concise explanations of the purpose, function, and components of the MAL code.", "output": "category ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

The primary asset is `Hardware`, which represents the physical devices on which applications can run.\n\n1. `attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, `successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, and `useVulnerability`: These steps model the attacker's ability to exploit vulnerabilities in the hardware, usually as a result of obtaining physical access. The `useVulnerability` step triggers the abuse of associated vulnerabilities.\n\n2. `attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, `successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, and `spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`: These steps model the attacker's ability to spread malware through removable media connected to the hardware system.\n\n3. `fullAccess`, `attemptSupplyChainAttack`, `successfulSupplyChainAttack`, `supplyChainAttack`, `supplyChainAuditing`, `bypassSupplyChainAuditing`, and `supplyChainAuditingBypassed`: These steps and associations represent hardware supply chain attacks, auditing, and bypasses. The `attemptSupplyChainAttack` is the entry point for modeling hardware supply chain attacks.\n\n4. `physicalAccess`, `attemptHardwareModifications`, `successfulHardwareModifications`, `hardwareModifications`, `hardwareModificationsProtection`, `bypassHardwareModificationsProtection`, and `hardwareModificationsProtectionBypassed`: These steps and associations model physical access to the hardware, hardware modifications, and defenses against unauthorized modifications.\n\n5. `attemptUnsafeUserActivity`, `successfulUnsafeUserActivity`, and `unsafeUserActivity`: These steps model unsafe user activities that expose the applications running on the hardware and fulfill the physical access requirement of software vulnerabilities associated with them.\n\n6. `deny`, `read`, and `modify`: These steps model denial of service, read, and modify attacks on the hardware, respectively, leading to corresponding actions on the applications running on it and the hosted data.\n\nEach step or association can have a level of difficulty (ranging from Easy, Medium, Hard, VeryHard, or Uncertain) and an indication of whether it can be hidden from detection. The `@hidden` attribute is used to mark attack steps that are not immediately visible or detectable. The `[VeryHardAndUncertain]` indicates that the step is both difficult and uncertain to execute.\n\nThis MAL code provides a structured way to model various cybersecurity threats related to hardware, including physical access, hardware modifications, supply chain attacks, and unsafe user activities.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis MAL code defines an asset named \"Application\" which represents any type of software process or component, from firmware and operating systems to plugins and sessions. The purpose of this asset is to model potential attack vectors on software applications.\n\nThe MAL code includes several components:\n\n1. **Vulnerabilities**: Represents potential weaknesses or security flaws in the application that an attacker can exploit. These vulnerabilities are categorized as soft product vulnerabilities if they are associated with the software product that the application is running.\n\n2. **Application Connections**: Represents outgoing and incoming connections between applications. Outgoing connections can be either outgoingAppConnections or appConnections, while ingoing connections can be either ingoingAppConnections or appConnections.\n\n3. **Defenses**: The MAL code includes several defense mechanisms that model the effectiveness of various security measures. These defenses include IDPS bypasses, software auditing, and supply chain auditing.\n\nThe logical flow of the MAL code involves several attack steps that represent potential actions an attacker can take to exploit vulnerabilities, gain access to the application, and perform malicious activities. These attack steps include attempting to use vulnerabilities, reverse reach, local and network connect, specific access, accessing networks and connections, and unsafe user activity.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several intermediate attack steps that allow for defenses and trigger bypasses. These steps can be bypassed under certain conditions, such as when defenses are successful or when specific requirements are met (e.g., the attacker has physical access to the hardware).\n\nThe MAL code also includes attack steps that conditionally trigger software product vulnerabilities separately for each application associated with the software product. This is useful for modeling scenarios where the same software product is used across multiple applications, and vulnerabilities in the software product can affect all associated applications.\n\nOverall, the MAL code in this example is designed to model attack scenarios on software applications, including potential vulnerabilities, connections between applications, defense mechanisms, and attack steps that can be taken by an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities. The code follows best practices for technical documentation, using clear and concise language to explain the purpose and function of each component and attack step.\n\nMAL Code:\nasset Application\n      user info: \"An application models any type of software process or component, from firmware and operating systems to plugins and sessions.\"\n      modeler info: \"Applications are some of the most common assets in models due to their versatility and scope.\"\n    {\n      let allVulnerabilities = vulnerabilities \\/ appSoftProduct.softProductVulnerabilities\n\n      let outgoingApplicationConnections = (appConnections \\/ outgoingAppConnections)\n      let ingoingApplicationConnections = (appConnections \\/ ingoingAppConnections)\n\n      # notPresent [Disabled]\n        user info: \"This defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset.

The purpose of this asset is to model potential attack vectors on software applications.\n\nThe MAL code includes several components:\n\n1. **Vulnerabilities**: Represents potential weaknesses or security flaws in the application that an attacker can exploit. These vulnerabilities are categorized as soft product vulnerabilities if they are associated with the software product that the application is running.\n\n2. **Application Connections**: Represents outgoing and incoming connections between applications. Outgoing connections can be either outgoingAppConnections or appConnections, while ingoing connections can be either ingoingAppConnections or appConnections.\n\n3. **Defenses**: The MAL code includes several defense mechanisms that model the effectiveness of various security measures. These defenses include IDPS bypasses, software auditing, and supply chain auditing.\n\nThe logical flow of the MAL code involves several attack steps that represent potential actions an attacker can take to exploit vulnerabilities, gain access to the application, and perform malicious activities. These attack steps include attempting to use vulnerabilities, reverse reach, local and network connect, specific access, accessing networks and connections, and unsafe user activity.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several intermediate attack steps that allow for defenses and trigger bypasses. These steps can be bypassed under certain conditions, such as when defenses are successful or when specific requirements are met (e.g., the attacker has physical access to the hardware).\n\nThe MAL code also includes attack steps that conditionally trigger software product vulnerabilities separately for each application associated with the software product. This is useful for modeling scenarios where the same software product is used across multiple applications, and vulnerabilities in the software product can affect all associated applications.\n\nOverall, the MAL code in this example is designed to model attack scenarios on software applications, including potential vulnerabilities, connections between applications, defense mechanisms, and attack steps that can be taken by an attacker to exploit these vulnerabilities.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a category named `DataResources` that includes two assets: `Information` and `Data`. This category serves as a foundation for threat modeling cybersecurity scenarios involving data storage and transmission.\n\n1. **Information**: This abstract asset represents any type of information that might be contained inside data. It serves as the basis for more specialized types such as Credentials and SoftwareProduct.\n\n   - **read**: The attacker is able to read the information but may not be able to extract it. This can occur if autonomous code reads it, but lacks the necessary networking connections to transmit it back to the adversary.\n   - **write**: The attacker is able to write the information. This allows them to overwrite, modify, or delete the information.\n   - **delete**: The attacker is able to delete the information. This also includes the ability to deny the information, which means the information becomes inaccessible.\n   - **deny**: The attacker is able to deny the information, making it inaccessible. This is equivalent to deleting the information.\n   - **extract**: The attacker is able to extract the information, which means they have a path available through which they can transfer the information back to a system they control.\n   - **attemptReadFromReplica, attemptWriteFromReplica, attemptDeleteFromReplica, attemptDenyFromReplica, attemptExtractFromReplica**: These attack steps are used to implement data replication. When reading one replica, all other replicas can be read as well since the information contained in them is the same. Information can only be overwritten, deleted, or denied if all replicas have been overwritten, deleted, or denied, respectively.\n\n2. **Data**: This asset represents any form of data that can be stored or transmitted. It includes several attack steps such as:\n\n   - **read**: The attacker can read the data. This means that the data can be used for further attack steps, but the attacker may not have obtained the data. The `extract` attack step covers the scenario where the attacker collects the data.\n   - **write**: The attacker can write to the location of the data, effectively modifying or deleting it.\n   - **delete**: The attacker can delete the data. This also includes the ability to deny the data, which has the same effects as deleting the data.\n   - **deny**: If a Denial of Service (DoS) is performed, data are denied, which is equivalent to deleting the data.\n   - **extract**: The attacker can extract the data.\n   - **authorizedAccessFromApplication**: The attacker can gain access to the data through permissions.\n   - **accessUnencryptedData, accessUnsignedData**: These intermediate attack steps allow effects of `accessUnencryptedData` and `accessUnsignedData` on data after compromising the encryption or signing credentials or when encryption or signing is disabled.\n   - **accessSpoofedData, accessDecryptedData**: These intermediate attack steps handle defenses and determine the effects on data after compromising the signing credentials or signing is disabled, or after compromising the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled, respectively.\n   - **attemptApplicationRespondConnect**: This intermediate attack step allows for defenses when performing a respond connect attack.\n   - **authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromApplication, authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromIAM**: These intermediate attack steps determine if the attacker can attempt a respond connect attack from an Application or if they have obtained the access control permissions required to modify the incoming requests.\n   - **attemptRead, attemptWrite, attemptDelete, attemptDeny**: These intermediate attack steps allow for defenses.\n   - **reverseReach**: This association determines whether or not the data can be transferred to the attacker.\n\nThe MAL code also defines several associations between the assets, such as `containingData`, `containedData`, `sentData`, `receivedData`, `transitData`, `hostedData`, `containerData`, `dataReplicas`, `dataDependedUpon`, and `infoDependedUpon`.

This category serves as a foundation for threat modeling cybersecurity scenarios involving data storage and transmission.\n\n1. **Information**: This abstract asset represents any type of information that might be contained inside data. It serves as the basis for more specialized types such as Credentials and SoftwareProduct.\n\n   - **read**: The attacker is able to read the information but may not be able to extract it. This can occur if autonomous code reads it, but lacks the necessary networking connections to transmit it back to the adversary.\n   - **write**: The attacker is able to write the information. This allows them to overwrite, modify, or delete the information.\n   - **delete**: The attacker is able to delete the information. This also includes the ability to deny the information, which means the information becomes inaccessible.\n   - **deny**: The attacker is able to deny the information, making it inaccessible. This is equivalent to deleting the information.\n   - **extract**: The attacker is able to extract the information, which means they have a path available through which they can transfer the information back to a system they control.\n   - **attemptReadFromReplica, attemptWriteFromReplica, attemptDeleteFromReplica, attemptDenyFromReplica, attemptExtractFromReplica**: These attack steps are used to implement data replication. When reading one replica, all other replicas can be read as well since the information contained in them is the same. Information can only be overwritten, deleted, or denied if all replicas have been overwritten, deleted, or denied, respectively.\n\n2. **Data**: This asset represents any form of data that can be stored or transmitted. It includes several attack steps such as:\n\n   - **read**: The attacker can read the data. This means that the data can be used for further attack steps, but the attacker may not have obtained the data. The `extract` attack step covers the scenario where the attacker collects the data.\n   - **write**: The attacker can write to the location of the data, effectively modifying or deleting it.\n   - **delete**: The attacker can delete the data. This also includes the ability to deny the data, which has the same effects as deleting the data.\n   - **deny**: If a Denial of Service (DoS) is performed, data are denied, which is equivalent to deleting the data.\n   - **extract**: The attacker can extract the data.\n   - **authorizedAccessFromApplication**: The attacker can gain access to the data through permissions.\n   - **accessUnencryptedData, accessUnsignedData**: These intermediate attack steps allow effects of `accessUnencryptedData` and `accessUnsignedData` on data after compromising the encryption or signing credentials or when encryption or signing is disabled.\n   - **accessSpoofedData, accessDecryptedData**: These intermediate attack steps handle defenses and determine the effects on data after compromising the signing credentials or signing is disabled, or after compromising the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled, respectively.\n   - **attemptApplicationRespondConnect**: This intermediate attack step allows for defenses when performing a respond connect attack.\n   - **authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromApplication, authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromIAM**: These intermediate attack steps determine if the attacker can attempt a respond connect attack from an Application or if they have obtained the access control permissions required to modify the incoming requests.\n   - **attemptRead, attemptWrite, attemptDelete, attemptDeny**: These intermediate attack steps allow for defenses.\n   - **reverseReach**: This association determines whether or not the data can be transferred to the attacker.\n\nThe MAL code also defines several associations between the assets, such as `containingData`, `containedData`, `sentData`, `receivedData`, `transitData`, `hostedData`, `containerData`, `dataReplicas`, `dataDependedUpon`, and `infoDependedUpon`.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a category named `DataResources` which includes two assets: `Information` and `Data`.\n\n1. The `Information` asset represents any type of information that might be contained inside data. It serves as the basis for more specialized types such as `Credentials` and `SoftwareProduct`. The `Information` asset has several attack steps: `read`, `write`, `delete`, `deny`, and `extract`.\n\n   - `read` allows the attacker to read the information, but not necessarily obtain it. The attacker might still be unable to extract it, even if they can read it. This is the case if autonomous code can read it but lacks the required networking connections to transmit it back to the attacker.\n\n   - `write` allows the attacker to write the information. This also enables the attacker to delete the information and deny its access.\n\n   - `delete` allows the attacker to delete the information.\n\n   - `deny` allows the attacker to deny the information, which has the same effects as deleting the data.\n\n   - `extract` allows the attacker to extract the information, meaning the attacker has a path available through which they can transfer the information back to a system they control.\n\n   - There are also hidden attack steps (denoted by the `@hidden` keyword) that are used to implement data replication and handle defenses.\n\n2. The `Data` asset represents any form of data that can be stored or transmitted. It has several defenses, attack steps, and hidden attack steps.\n\n   - The `notPresent` defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset. It models the possibility of data not existing on the associated container.\n\n   - `authorizedAccessFromApplication` tries to gain access to the data through permissions.\n\n   - If the data are encrypted, accessing them requires the associated encryption credentials/key. Data will be considered encrypted if there is at least one `Credentials` instance associated with it. Otherwise, `accessUnencryptedData` is triggered.\n\n   - If the data are signed, writing them requires the associated signing credentials/key. Data will be considered signed if there is at least one `Credentials` asset associated with it. Otherwise, `accessUnsignedData` is triggered.\n\n   - There are several attack steps related to bypassing payload inspection when data are encrypted.\n\n   - `accessUnencryptedData` and `accessUnsignedData` are intermediate attack steps that allow effects of `accessUnencryptedData` on data after compromising the encryption credentials or signing is disabled, and `accessUnsignedData` on data after compromising the signing credentials or signing is disabled, respectively.\n\n   - Various attack steps are defined to handle defenses, read, write, delete, deny, and extract data, and attempt reverse reach to determine whether or not the data can be transferred to the attacker.\n\nThis MAL code provides a detailed model for analyzing and understanding the attack paths on data resources, including data encryption, signing, and replication. It also takes into account various defenses that can be implemented to protect the data.\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory DataResources {\n\n    asset Information\n      user info: \"Represents any type of information that might be contained inside Data.

The `Information` asset has several attack steps: `read`, `write`, `delete`, `deny`, and `extract`.\n\n   - `read` allows the attacker to read the information, but not necessarily obtain it. The attacker might still be unable to extract it, even if they can read it. This is the case if autonomous code can read it but lacks the required networking connections to transmit it back to the attacker.\n\n   - `write` allows the attacker to write the information.

Data will be considered encrypted if there is at least one `Credentials` instance associated with it. Otherwise, `accessUnencryptedData` is triggered.\n\n   - If the data are signed, writing them requires the associated signing credentials/key. Data will be considered signed if there is at least one `Credentials` asset associated with it. Otherwise, `accessUnsignedData` is triggered.\n\n   - There are several attack steps related to bypassing payload inspection when data are encrypted.\n\n   - `accessUnencryptedData` and `accessUnsignedData` are intermediate attack steps that allow effects of `accessUnencryptedData` on data after compromising the encryption credentials or signing is disabled, and `accessUnsignedData` on data after compromising the signing credentials or signing is disabled, respectively.\n\n   - Various attack steps are defined to handle defenses, read, write, delete, deny, and extract data, and attempt reverse reach to determine whether or not the data can be transferred to the attacker.\n\nThis MAL code provides a detailed model for analyzing and understanding the attack paths on data resources, including data encryption, signing, and replication.

This can occur when autonomous code reads the information but lacks the necessary networking connections to transmit it back to the attacker.\n   - `write`: The attacker is able to modify the information stored in the data replicas, container data, and, given full access, dependent applications.\n   - `delete`: The attacker is able to delete the information from the data replicas, container data, and, by denying access, dependent applications.\n   - `deny`: The attacker is able to deny access to the information for data replicas, container data, and dependent applications.\n   - `extract`: The attacker is able to extract the information, meaning they have a path available through which they can transfer the information back to a system they control.\n\n3. **Data Replicas**: The attacker can attempt to read, write, delete, deny, or extract information from replicas.

This can occur when autonomous code reads the information but lacks the necessary networking connections to transmit it back to the attacker.\n   - `write`: The attacker is able to modify the information stored in the data replicas, container data, and, given full access, dependent applications.\n   - `delete`: The attacker is able to delete the information from the data replicas, container data, and, by denying access, dependent applications.\n   - `deny`: The attacker is able to deny access to the information for data replicas, container data, and dependent applications.\n   - `extract`: The attacker is able to extract the information, meaning they have a path available through which they can transfer the information back to a system they control.\n\n3. **Data Replicas**: The attacker can attempt to read, write, delete, deny, or extract information from replicas. Reading one replica allows the attacker to read all other replicas since the information contained in them is the same. Information can only be overwritten, deleted, denied, or extracted if all replicas have been affected.\n\n4. **Container Data**: The attacker can read, write, delete, or deny access to container data, which likely represents the primary storage of user information.\n\n5. **Dependent Apps**: The attacker can gain full access to, delete, or deny access to dependent applications, implying that these applications rely on the user information for their operation.\n\nThis MAL code outlines a threat model for an attacker attempting to manipulate user information through various means, such as reading, writing, deleting, denying access, or extracting the information. The model takes into account data replication, as the attacker can only affect all replicas to successfully perform certain actions.", "output": "asset Information\n      user info: \"Represents any type of information that might be contained inside Data.

The primary asset in this model is user information, which can be stored or transmitted.\n\nThe MAL code outlines various defensive measures and attack steps related to this data asset. The defense \"notPresent\" is used to model the scenario where the data is not present on the associated container (Hardware, Application, Network, etc.). By enabling this defense, all attack steps that rely on the presence of data are disabled.\n\nAttack steps include \"authorizedAccessFromApplication\", \"accessUnencryptedData\", \"accessUnsignedData\", \"accessSpoofedData\", \"accessDecryptedData\", \"attemptApplicationRespondConnect\", \"attemptRead\", \"successfulRead\", \"read\", \"attemptWrite\", \"successfulWrite\", \"write\", \"attemptDelete\", \"successfulDelete\", \"delete\", \"attemptDeny\", \"successfulDeny\", \"deny\", \"attemptReverseReach\", and \"reverseReach\".\n\n\"authorizedAccessFromApplication\" represents an attempt to gain access to the data through permissions. \"accessUnencryptedData\" and \"accessUnsignedData\" represent accessing unencrypted and unsigned data respectively. \"accessSpoofedData\" is an intermediate attack step that allows the effects of \"accessUnsignedData\" on data after the signing credentials or signing is disabled. \"accessDecryptedData\" is another intermediate step that allows the effects of \"accessUnencryptedData\" on data after the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled.\n\n\"attemptApplicationRespondConnect\" is an intermediate attack step to handle defenses. \"attemptRead\", \"read\", \"attemptWrite\", \"write\", \"attemptDelete\", and \"delete\" are attack steps that represent the attempt and successful completion of reading, writing, and deleting data respectively. \"attemptDeny\" and \"deny\" represent attempts and successful denial of data. \"attemptReverseReach\" and \"reverseReach\" are used to determine whether or not the data can be transferred to the attacker.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several hidden elements that are not directly exposed to the user. These include \"encryptCreds\" and \"signingCreds\", which are used to determine if data are encrypted or signed respectively. \"payloadInspectionBypassFromEncryptedData\" is triggered if data are encrypted and represents the bypassing of payload inspection on the connection rules they are transmitted over. \"bypassPayloadInspectionFromEncryptedData\" is an intermediate attack step that implies the connection rules that the encrypted data traverse over cannot provide payload inspection since they are assumed to permit encrypted traffic.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a comprehensive model for analyzing cybersecurity threats related to user information, including defensive measures and various attack steps.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe MAL code provided defines a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for Identity and Access Management (IAM) threat modeling. This DSL, named `org.mal_lang.IAMlang`, is designed to model assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations for IAM roles such as Identity, Group, Privileges, and Credentials.\n\nThe core asset in this DSL is `IAMObject`, which acts as the base for all IAM assets. It has a defense called `notPresent`, which models the possibility that the asset doesn't exist. Other defense mechanisms include `deny`, `write`, and `lockout`, which model various attack scenarios such as denying access, overwriting, or locking out an asset.\n\nThe `Identity` asset extends `IAMObject` and represents an IAM identity that can be associated with privileges. An identity can be visualized as a group of assumable roles that can be associated with many credentials. It has an associated defense called `lockoutFromCredentials`, which models the lockout of an identity if all of the credentials that could be used to authenticate have been denied.\n\nThe `Privileges` asset also extends `IAMObject` and represents a subset of given privileges on applications and data. It is meant to be used as a speculative asset for reasoning about additional privileges that a particular group or identity may have.\n\nThe `Group` asset extends `IAMObject` and represents a way to group together identities and/or other groups. This allows for hierarchical IAM. A group can be compromised if one of its member identities is compromised.\n\nThe `Credentials` asset extends `Information` and represents a variety of access control mechanisms. It has defenses such as `notDisclosed`, `notGuessable`, `unique`, `notPhishable`, `read`, `write`, and `deny`. These defenses model various attack scenarios such as leaked credentials, guessable credentials, unique credentials, phishable credentials, and read, write, or denied credentials.\n\nThe MAL code also defines various associations between these assets, such as `encryptCreds`, `signingCreds`, `hashes`, `credentials`, `identities`, `parentId`, `memberOf`, `parentGroup`, `executionPrivIAMs`, `highPrivAppIAMs`, `lowPrivAppIAMs`, `readingIAMs`, `writingIAMs`, `deletingIAMs`, `IAMOwners`, and `managers`. These associations model various relationships between the assets, such as encryption, signing, hashing, conditional authentication, identity inheritance, group membership, application execution privileges, high privilege application access, low privilege application access, read privileges, write privileges, delete privileges, and account management roles.\n\nIn summary, this MAL code defines a DSL for IAM threat modeling, which allows for the modeling of assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations for IAM roles such as Identity, Group, Privileges, and Credentials. The DSL is designed to reason about various attack scenarios, such as denying access, overwriting, or locking out assets, leaked credentials, guessable credentials, unique credentials, phishable credentials, read, write, or denied credentials, and various relationships between assets.

This DSL, named `org.mal_lang.IAMlang`, is designed to model assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations for IAM roles such as Identity, Group, Privileges, and Credentials.\n\nThe core asset in this DSL is `IAMObject`, which acts as the base for all IAM assets. It has a defense called `notPresent`, which models the possibility that the asset doesn't exist. Other defense mechanisms include `deny`, `write`, and `lockout`, which model various attack scenarios such as denying access, overwriting, or locking out an asset.\n\nThe `Identity` asset extends `IAMObject` and represents an IAM identity that can be associated with privileges. An identity can be visualized as a group of assumable roles that can be associated with many credentials. It has an associated defense called `lockoutFromCredentials`, which models the lockout of an identity if all of the credentials that could be used to authenticate have been denied.\n\nThe `Privileges` asset also extends `IAMObject` and represents a subset of given privileges on applications and data. It is meant to be used as a speculative asset for reasoning about additional privileges that a particular group or identity may have.\n\nThe `Group` asset extends `IAMObject` and represents a way to group together identities and/or other groups. This allows for hierarchical IAM. A group can be compromised if one of its member identities is compromised.\n\nThe `Credentials` asset extends `Information` and represents a variety of access control mechanisms. It has defenses such as `notDisclosed`, `notGuessable`, `unique`, `notPhishable`, `read`, `write`, and `deny`. These defenses model various attack scenarios such as leaked credentials, guessable credentials, unique credentials, phishable credentials, and read, write, or denied credentials.\n\nThe MAL code also defines various associations between these assets, such as `encryptCreds`, `signingCreds`, `hashes`, `credentials`, `identities`, `parentId`, `memberOf`, `parentGroup`, `executionPrivIAMs`, `highPrivAppIAMs`, `lowPrivAppIAMs`, `readingIAMs`, `writingIAMs`, `deletingIAMs`, `IAMOwners`, and `managers`. These associations model various relationships between the assets, such as encryption, signing, hashing, conditional authentication, identity inheritance, group membership, application execution privileges, high privilege application access, low privilege application access, read privileges, write privileges, delete privileges, and account management roles.\n\nIn summary, this MAL code defines a DSL for IAM threat modeling, which allows for the modeling of assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations for IAM roles such as Identity, Group, Privileges, and Credentials. The DSL is designed to reason about various attack scenarios, such as denying access, overwriting, or locking out assets, leaked credentials, guessable credentials, unique credentials, phishable credentials, read, write, or denied credentials, and various relationships between assets. The DSL can be used to model and analyze IAM systems to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.IAMlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ncategory IAM {\n\n    abstract asset IAMObject extends Information\n      user info: \"An IAM object represents the base logic shared by all assets used for Identity and Access Management roles(Identity, Group, Privileges).\"\n    {\n      # notPresent [Disabled]\n        user info: \"This defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a category named IAM (Identity and Access Management) that represents assets for Identity, Group, Privileges, and Credentials. These assets are used to model threats and vulnerabilities in Identity and Access Management systems.\n\n1. IAMObject: This is an abstract asset representing the base logic for all assets used for Identity and Access Management roles. It has several components, including defense mechanisms such as `notPresent` (to reason about the absence of an asset), `attemptAssume`, `assume`, `deny`, `write`, `attemptLockout`, `lockout`, `successfulAssume`, `successfulLockout`, `attemptUnsafeUserActivity`, `unsafeUserActivity`, and their hidden counterparts. The logical flow involves attempting an action, then executing it if successful, and locking out the asset if denied.\n\n2. Identity: An Identity represents an IAM identity that can be associated with privileges. It has additional components such as `parentId`, `memberOf`, `users`, `credentials`, and `execPrivApps`, `highPrivApps`, `lowPrivApps`, `readPrivData`, `writePrivData`, `writePrivData.authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromIAM`, `deletePrivData`, `managedIAMs`, and `subprivileges`. The logical flow is similar to IAMObject, but it also includes the possibility of assuming the privileges of parent identities and locking out the Identity if all associated Credentials are weak or if all Users associated with the Identity are missing.\n\n3. Privileges: A Privileges asset can be associated with another IAMObject to reason about a specific subset of given privileges on Applications and Data. It has components similar to Identity, but it assumes the privileges of the associated Identity or Group since the privileges are simply an extension of them.\n\n4. Group: A Group is a way to group together identities and/or other groups. It has components such as `parentGroup`, and `memberOf`. The logical flow involves assuming the Group if an Identity of the Group is compromised and locking out the Group if all of its Identities are locked out.\n\n5. Credentials: Credentials can be used to access Identities or serve as encryption/signing keys for Data. It has components such as `read`, `write`, `deny`, `useLeakedCredentials`, `attemptCredentialsReuse`, `credentialsReuse`, `attemptUse`, `propagateOneCredentialCompromised`, `attemptCredentialTheft`, `credentialTheft`, `weakCredentials`, `guessCredentials`, `guessCredentialsFromHash`, and their hidden counterparts. The logical flow involves attempting to read, write, or deny the Credentials, using them if they are leaked or stolen, and guessing them if they are weak or if hashes associated with the Credentials are known.\n\nThe MAL code defines the structure and semantics of these assets, clarifying their purpose, function, and relationships. It also highlights domain-specific implications, such as the possibility of assuming parent identities' privileges when compromising an Identity, or the potential for a credentials reuse attack if Credentials are weak or reused. The MAL code is designed for technical audiences and follows best practices for technical documentation by being exhaustive but concise and using plain, professional language.\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory IAM {\n\n    abstract asset IAMObject extends Information\n      user info: \"An IAM object represents the base logic shared by all assets used for Identity and Access Management roles(Identity, Group, Privileges).\"\n    {\n      # notPresent [Disabled]\n        user info: \"This defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset.

These assets are used to model threats and vulnerabilities in Identity and Access Management systems.\n\n1. IAMObject: This is an abstract asset representing the base logic for all assets used for Identity and Access Management roles. It has several components, including defense mechanisms such as `notPresent` (to reason about the absence of an asset), `attemptAssume`, `assume`, `deny`, `write`, `attemptLockout`, `lockout`, `successfulAssume`, `successfulLockout`, `attemptUnsafeUserActivity`, `unsafeUserActivity`, and their hidden counterparts. The logical flow involves attempting an action, then executing it if successful, and locking out the asset if denied.\n\n2. Identity: An Identity represents an IAM identity that can be associated with privileges. It has additional components such as `parentId`, `memberOf`, `users`, `credentials`, and `execPrivApps`, `highPrivApps`, `lowPrivApps`, `readPrivData`, `writePrivData`, `writePrivData.authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromIAM`, `deletePrivData`, `managedIAMs`, and `subprivileges`. The logical flow is similar to IAMObject, but it also includes the possibility of assuming the privileges of parent identities and locking out the Identity if all associated Credentials are weak or if all Users associated with the Identity are missing.\n\n3. Privileges: A Privileges asset can be associated with another IAMObject to reason about a specific subset of given privileges on Applications and Data. It has components similar to Identity, but it assumes the privileges of the associated Identity or Group since the privileges are simply an extension of them.\n\n4. Group: A Group is a way to group together identities and/or other groups. It has components such as `parentGroup`, and `memberOf`. The logical flow involves assuming the Group if an Identity of the Group is compromised and locking out the Group if all of its Identities are locked out.\n\n5. Credentials: Credentials can be used to access Identities or serve as encryption/signing keys for Data. It has components such as `read`, `write`, `deny`, `useLeakedCredentials`, `attemptCredentialsReuse`, `credentialsReuse`, `attemptUse`, `propagateOneCredentialCompromised`, `attemptCredentialTheft`, `credentialTheft`, `weakCredentials`, `guessCredentials`, `guessCredentialsFromHash`, and their hidden counterparts. The logical flow involves attempting to read, write, or deny the Credentials, using them if they are leaked or stolen, and guessing them if they are weak or if hashes associated with the Credentials are known.\n\nThe MAL code defines the structure and semantics of these assets, clarifying their purpose, function, and relationships. It also highlights domain-specific implications, such as the possibility of assuming parent identities' privileges when compromising an Identity, or the potential for a credentials reuse attack if Credentials are weak or reused.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nTitle: MAL Code Analysis - IAMObject Asset\n\nDescription:\nThe given MAL code defines an asset called IAMObject, which represents the shared logic for Identity, Group, and Privilege assets used in Identity and Access Management (IAM). The IAMObject asset has several attack steps, defenses, and associations that model the potential threats and countermeasures associated with it.\n\nComponents:\n1. Asset: IAMObject - Represents the base logic for IAM assets such as Identity, Group, and Privileges.\n2. Defenses:\n   - notPresent [Disabled] - This defense models the possibility that the IAMObject does not exist, effectively disabling its impactful attack steps.\n   - assume - Allows an attacker to assume the IAMObject, granting them access to associated privileges and potentially exploitable behavior.\n   - deny - Denies access to Identity, Group, or Privileges, making them unavailable to legitimate users and potentially causing lockouts.\n   - write - Overwrites Identity, Group, or Privileges, allowing the attacker to assume them.\n   - successfulAssume, successfulLockout, attemptAssume, attemptLockout - These are intermediate attack steps and defenses used for modeling and handling the logical flow of the attack scenario.\n\nAttack Steps:\n1. assume - Allows an attacker to assume an IAM asset, potentially exploiting its privileges.\n2. deny - Denies access to Identity, Group, or Privileges, making them unavailable to legitimate users and potentially causing lockouts.\n3. write - Overwrites Identity, Group, or Privileges, allowing the attacker to assume them.\n4. attemptAssume, attemptLockout - Intermediate attack steps used for modeling and handling the logical flow of the attack scenario.\n\nAssociations:\n1. execPrivApps, highPrivApps, lowPrivApps, readPrivData, writePrivData, writePrivData.authorizedApplicationRespondConnectFromIAM, deletePrivData, managedIAMs, subprivileges - These associations represent the privileges that can be exploited when an attacker assumes an IAMObject.\n\nLogical Flow and Relationships:\nThe IAMObject asset can be assumed by an attacker, granting them access to associated privileges. If the IAMObject is denied, it becomes unavailable to legitimate users and may cause lockouts. Overwriting an IAMObject allows the attacker to assume it. The successfulAssume, successfulLockout, attemptAssume, and attemptLockout steps are used to model the logical flow and defenses in the attack scenario.\n\nDomain-Specific Implications:\nThis MAL code is specific to Identity and Access Management, focusing on the threats and countermeasures related to IAM assets such as Identity, Group, and Privileges.

The primary components in this MAL code include:\n\n1. **Credentials**: Represents various types of sensitive information such as encryption credentials, signing credentials, hashed credentials, and conditional authentication factors.\n\n   - EncryptionCredentials, SigningCredentials, and Credentials can be associated with Data assets through the encryptCreds, signingCreds, and credentials associations, respectively.\n   - HashedCredentials are associated with their original Credentials through the hashes association. Multiple hashes can be generated for the same Credentials, but a hash is unique to one set of Credentials.\n   - ConditionalAuthentication is used to associate Credentials with other Credentials, representing multi-factor authentication scenarios.\n\n2. **Identity**: Represents entities that can be authenticated, such as users or services.\n\n   - IdentityCredentials are associated with Credentials, representing the authentication factors for an Identity.\n   - CanAssume association is a self-referential association that defines a parent-child relationship between Identities, allowing for the assumption of child Identities due to inheritance.\n\n3. **Group**: Represents a collection of Identities.\n\n   - MemberOf association defines the membership of an Identity in a Group.\n   - A Group can have parent and child Groups, also through the MemberOf association, representing a hierarchy of groups.\n\n4. **IAMObject**: Represents the access control objects, including Identities (Identity), Groups, and Privileges.\n\n   - executionPrivIAMs, highPrivAppIAMs, lowPrivAppIAMs, readingIAMs, writingIAMs, and deletingIAMs define the access privileges on various assets, such as Applications and Data.\n   - IAMOwners association allows for logical separation of a subset of Privileges within an IAMObject.\n   - AccountManagement association is a self-referential association that defines account management roles within an IAMObject.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. Credentials are associated with Data assets through encryption, signing, or conditional authentication mechanisms.\n2. Credentials can also be associated with their hashed counterparts, and multiple hashes can be generated for the same Credentials.\n3. Identities are associated with Credentials through the IdentityCredentials association, representing the authentication factors for an Identity.\n4. Identities can be grouped together, and groups can have a hierarchy, with parent and child groups.\n5. Access control is defined on the application level through execution privileges, high privilege application access, and low privilege application access.\n6. Access control is defined on the data level through reading, writing, and deleting privileges.\n7. Privileges can be logically separated into subsets through the IAMOwners association.\n8. Account management roles can be defined within IAMObjects through the AccountManagement association.\n\nThis MAL code focuses on access control and credential management, providing a structured way to model various cybersecurity scenarios, including multi-factor authentication, access control on applications and data, and the inheritance of privileges and identities.

Four attack steps are defined for gaining physical access to the network:\n   - `physicalAccess @entrypoint {C, A}`, which allows the attacker to cut wires/fibers, connect using iLOs, eavesdrop, and gain proper network access.\n   - `bypassEavesdropDefenseFromPhysicalAccess` and `bypassAdversaryInTheMiddleDefenseFromPhysicalAccess` allow the attacker to bypass eavesdrop and adversary-in-the-middle defenses, respectively.\n   - `networkAccessControl` represents the access control that protects from unauthorized physical access on the network.\n\nAfter gaining physical access, the attacker can attempt to bypass the access control and then access the network uninspected or inspected. If access is successful, the attacker can perform various actions, such as attempting to reverse reach, network forwarding, accessing network data, eavesdropping, and adversary-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThere are also two defenses defined in this MAL code:\n\n1. `eavesdropDefense` protects against eavesdrop attacks, and `adversaryInTheMiddleDefense` protects against adversary-in-the-middle attacks. These defenses can be bypassed if the attacker has physical access to the network or if they are disabled.\n\nIn addition to the Network asset, there are two other assets defined:\n\n1. `RoutingFirewall` extends the Application asset and represents a router with firewall capabilities that connects many networks.\n2. `ConnectionRule` is used to model firewall rules between applications and/or networks. The association selected (bi/uni-directional) only describes the connection initiation. This asset is mainly used to model the functionality of a network connection through a firewall.\n\nThe associations in this MAL code define the relationships between the assets. For example, a routing firewall has routing or firewall rules specified by connections between networks or applications. An application can communicate or be exposed on a network, and an application can communicate over one or more bidirectional connections. Two or more applications can also be inter-connected via uni-directional connections. Similarly, two or more networks can be inter-connected via bidirectional, uni-directional, or diode connections.\n\nThis MAL code defines the logical flow and relationships between the elements in a networking threat model. The attacker's goal is to gain physical access to the network and then bypass various defenses to access the network and perform various actions. The networking assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations defined in this MAL code provide a way to model and analyze networking threats. The domain-specific implications of this MAL code are relevant to cybersecurity professionals who are tasked with threat modeling networking scenarios.\n\nMAL Code:\n#id: \"org.mal_lang.Networkinglang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\ncategory Networking {\n\n    asset Network\n      user info: \"A network (zone) is a set of network accessible applications and data.\"\n      developer info: \"The network asset tries to cover all the levels of the OSI stack in a very abstract and compact way (i.e. it tries to represent all the OSI layers).

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a threat modeling language for cybersecurity, focusing on network-related threats. The model includes assets such as a network (zone), a routing firewall, and a connection rule.\n\n1. **Network (zone)**: Represents a set of network-accessible applications and data. It attempts to cover all levels of the OSI stack, including ARP attacks (Layer 2) and DNS/HTTP spoofing attacks (Layer 7). The network asset allows for physical access, eavesdropping, and adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks. Access control, eavesdrop defense, and AitM defense are defined as defenses to counter these threats.\n\n   - **Physical Access**: Grants the attacker network access through physical means, such as cutting wires, eavesdropping, or gaining access to iLOs.\n   - **Eavesdrop Defense**: Protects from eavesdrop attacks like ARP spoofing. If this defense is bypassed, the network is considered a broadcast network for eavesdropping purposes.\n   - **Adversary In The Middle Defense**: Protects against AitM attacks originating from the network layer or higher network layers.\n   - **Access Control**: Protects from unauthorized physical access on the network. If this defense is bypassed, the attacker gains access to the network.\n\n2. **Routing Firewall**: A routing firewall is an extension of the application asset, specifying a router with firewall capabilities that connects many networks. Full access to the routing firewall results in the complete compromise of the device, allowing all connections.\n\n3. **Connection Rule**: This asset models firewall rules between applications and/or networks. It can be used to model the functionality of a network connection through a firewall and the data in transit. The connection rule includes the restricted defense and payload inspection defense, which can be bypassed to allow access to networks and applications.\n\n   - **Restricted Defense**: Probabilistically models the likelihood of the protocols required by the attack being enabled or the existence of the ConnectionRule itself.\n   - **Payload Inspection**: If enabled, the traffic is considered to be inspected and filtered by an IDPS, allowing only legitimate communication.\n\nThe MAL code also includes various attack steps, such as attemptAccessUninspectedFromPhysicalAccess, attemptAccessInspectedFromPhysicalAccess, attemptReverseReach, attemptEavesdrop, and attemptAdversaryInTheMiddle. These steps model the defenses, bypasses, and logical flow between the different components in the network threat model. The associations between assets, attack steps, defenses, and relationships are clearly defined, making it easier to understand the potential threats and vulnerabilities in a network.\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory Networking {\n\n    asset Network\n      user info: \"A network (zone) is a set of network accessible applications and data.\"\n      developer info: \"The network asset tries to cover all the levels of the OSI stack in a very abstract and compact way (i.e. it tries to represent all the OSI layers).

The model includes assets such as a network (zone), a routing firewall, and a connection rule.\n\n1. **Network (zone)**: Represents a set of network-accessible applications and data. It attempts to cover all levels of the OSI stack, including ARP attacks (Layer 2) and DNS/HTTP spoofing attacks (Layer 7). The network asset allows for physical access, eavesdropping, and adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks. Access control, eavesdrop defense, and AitM defense are defined as defenses to counter these threats.\n\n   - **Physical Access**: Grants the attacker network access through physical means, such as cutting wires, eavesdropping, or gaining access to iLOs.\n   - **Eavesdrop Defense**: Protects from eavesdrop attacks like ARP spoofing. If this defense is bypassed, the network is considered a broadcast network for eavesdropping purposes.\n   - **Adversary In The Middle Defense**: Protects against AitM attacks originating from the network layer or higher network layers.\n   - **Access Control**: Protects from unauthorized physical access on the network. If this defense is bypassed, the attacker gains access to the network.\n\n2. **Routing Firewall**: A routing firewall is an extension of the application asset, specifying a router with firewall capabilities that connects many networks. Full access to the routing firewall results in the complete compromise of the device, allowing all connections.\n\n3. **Connection Rule**: This asset models firewall rules between applications and/or networks. It can be used to model the functionality of a network connection through a firewall and the data in transit. The connection rule includes the restricted defense and payload inspection defense, which can be bypassed to allow access to networks and applications.\n\n   - **Restricted Defense**: Probabilistically models the likelihood of the protocols required by the attack being enabled or the existence of the ConnectionRule itself.\n   - **Payload Inspection**: If enabled, the traffic is considered to be inspected and filtered by an IDPS, allowing only legitimate communication.\n\nThe MAL code also includes various attack steps, such as attemptAccessUninspectedFromPhysicalAccess, attemptAccessInspectedFromPhysicalAccess, attemptReverseReach, attemptEavesdrop, and attemptAdversaryInTheMiddle. These steps model the defenses, bypasses, and logical flow between the different components in the network threat model.

The network asset is designed to cover all levels of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, encompassing attacks ranging from ARP (Layer 2) to DNS/HTTP spoofing (Layer 7).\n\nThe asset consists of several components:\n\n1. `outboundAllowedConnections`, `inboundAllowedConnections`, and `allNetConnections`: These variables represent the allowed network connections, both incoming and outgoing, as well as the total network connections.\n\n2. `allowedApplicationConnectionsApplications`: This variable represents the applications that are associated with the allowed network connections.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several attack steps:\n\n1. `physicalAccess @entrypoint {C, A}`: This attack step represents an attacker gaining physical access to the network, enabling activities such as cutting wires, eavesdropping, and getting proper network access.\n\n2. Several attack steps related to bypassing defenses, such as `bypassEavesdropDefenseFromPhysicalAccess`, `bypassAdversaryInTheMiddleDefenseFromPhysicalAccess`, and `bypassAccessControl`. These steps demonstrate how an attacker can bypass network defenses when they have physical access to the network.\n\n3. `networkAccessControl`: This defense protects from unauthorized physical access on the network.\n\n4. `attemptAccessUninspectedFromPhysicalAccess` and `attemptAccessInspectedFromPhysicalAccess`: These intermediate steps represent the attacker attempting to access the network, either uninspected (without restrictions) or inspected (with limitations).\n\n5. `accessUninspected` and `accessInspected`: These steps represent the successful network access, either uninspected or inspected.\n\n6. `attemptReverseReach`, `reverseReach`, `networkForwardingUninspected`, `networkForwardingInspected`, `deny`, `accessNetworkData`, `eavesdropDefense`, `bypassEavesdropDefense`, `attemptEavesdrop`, `successfulEavesdrop`, `eavesdrop`, `adversaryInTheMiddleDefense`, `bypassAdversaryInTheMiddleDefense`, `attemptAdversaryInTheMiddle`, `successfulAdversaryInTheMiddle`, `adversaryInTheMiddle`: These steps represent various network-related activities, such as attempting to reverse reach, network forwarding, denying connections, accessing network data, eavesdropping, and adversary-in-the-middle (AitM) attacks.\n\nThe logical flow of the MAL code starts with an attacker gaining physical access to the network (`physicalAccess @entrypoint {C, A}`). From there, the attacker attempts to bypass network defenses (`bypassAccessControl`, `bypassEavesdropDefenseFromPhysicalAccess`, `bypassAdversaryInTheMiddleDefenseFromPhysicalAccess`) and access the network (`attemptAccessUninspectedFromPhysicalAccess`, `attemptAccessInspectedFromPhysicalAccess`). If successful, the attacker can perform various activities, such as eavesdropping, reverse reaching, network forwarding, denying connections, and accessing network data.\n\nThe MAL code also highlights domain-specific implications, such as the need to consider eavesdrop defenses for attacks like ARP spoofing and DNS poisoning, and the importance of adversary-in-the-middle defenses for protecting against AitM attacks at both the network and higher layers.\n\nMAL Code:\nasset Network\n      user info: \"A network (zone) is a set of network accessible applications and data.\"\n      developer info: \"The network asset tries to cover all the levels of the OSI stack in a very abstract and compact way (i.e. it tries to represent all the OSI layers).

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a category for various assets in a cybersecurity threat modeling context. The category is called \"Product\" and includes several sub-assets: LogicalDevice, LogicalNode, IED (Industrial Electronic Device), Server, Data, Router, and Clock.\n\n1. LogicalDevice: Represents a logical device in the system. It has an impact associated with it that is inherited from its parent LogicalNode.\n\n2. LogicalNode: Represents a logical node in the system, which can be an equipment, sub-equipment, transformer, or data. Each LogicalNode has an impact and is associated with three execution points: equipment, subEquipment, transformer, and data. The impact is the consequence of an attack on the LogicalNode.\n\n3. IED: Represents an Industrial Electronic Device. It has an access point for communication and can act as a router. The communication can be either initiated or received from the accessPoint. An IED with a router role will inherit the accessPoint.router association.\n\n4. Server: Represents a server in the system. It has a communication access point and an impact associated with the logical devices it affects (logicalDev).\n\n5. Data: Represents data in the system. It has an impact that is associated with the LogicalNodes in the system.\n\n6. Router: Represents a router in the system. It has a communication access point.\n\n7. Clock: Represents a clock in the system. It has both an impact and a communication access point.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code is based on the inheritance and association relationships between the assets. For example, LogicalDevices and LogicalNodes inherit the impact property from their parent LogicalNode.

The association type defines the nature of the relationship between the source and target elements.\n\n2. `association_id`: A unique identifier for the association, used to refer to it elsewhere in the MAL model.\n\n3. `source_element`: This is the element that initiates the association, which can be an asset, attack step, or defense.\n\n4. `target_element`: This is the element that the association points to, which can also be an asset, attack step, or defense.\n\n5. `association_properties` (optional): This is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional information about the association, such as the data direction (`in`, `out`, or `bidirectional`), the attacker's motivation, or the common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) identifier for a known vulnerability being exploited.\n\nThe `associations` block helps to visualize and understand the relationships between different components in a cybersecurity threat model, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of potential threats. Understanding these relationships is crucial for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, as it allows analysts to identify attack paths, data flows, and vulnerability exploitations that could lead to security breaches.", "output": "associations {\n\n}", "type": "association"}}

For instance, `attemptSocialEngineering` can lead to `successfulSocialEngineering`, which in turn can lead to `socialEngineering`. Similarly, `attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia` can lead to `successfulDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia`, which can lead to `deliverMaliciousRemovableMedia`.\n\nThis MAL code is specific to modeling threats related to user behavior and security awareness, with a focus on social engineering and the use of removable media.

Furthermore, the identities associated with a user can be used to track and control their actions within the system.", "output": "associations {\n  User [users] * <-- ZoneAccess            --> * [physicalZones]   PhysicalZone\n      user info: \"A user may have access to different physical zones.\"\n  User [users] * <-- HardwareAccess        --> * [hardwareSystems] Hardware\n      user info: \"A user may have access to different hardware systems, rigs, or components.\"\n  User [users] * <-- UserAssignedIdentities--> * [userIds]         Identity\n      user info: \"A user may have different identities associated with it.\"\n}", "type": "association"}}
{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a Vulnerability language category, which is used to model vulnerabilities in software and hardware systems. The category has two main asset types: `SoftwareVulnerability` and `HardwareVulnerability`, each representing a vulnerability that affects software or hardware, respectively.\n\n**SoftwareVulnerability**\n- Purpose: Represents a vulnerability that affects software, such as applications or software products.\n- Function: This asset defines several defenses and attack steps that help model the attack process, impact, and complexity of software vulnerabilities. These elements are based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) specification, covering network, local, physical access, user interaction, and access privilege requirements, as well as confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.\n\nDefenses:\n- `networkAccessRequired`, `localAccessRequired`, `physicalAccessRequired`: These defenses model the network, local, and physical access requirements for exploiting a software vulnerability. If a defense is disabled, it indicates that the vulnerability does not require the attacker to fulfill that requirement.\n- `lowPrivilegesRequired`, `highPrivilegesRequired`: These defenses specify whether the attacker needs low or high privileges to exploit the vulnerability. If a defense is disabled, the vulnerability does not require the attacker to have specific privileges.\n- `userInteractionRequired`: This defense models the probability of user interaction required for exploiting the software vulnerability. If enabled, the attacker may require user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.\n- `confidentialityImpactLimitations`, `availabilityImpactLimitations`, `integrityImpactLimitations`: These defenses limit the impact on confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the system, respectively.\n- `highComplexityExploitRequired`: This defense indicates that the vulnerability relies on a high complexity exploit that requires the attacker to expend additional effort (time) in order to successfully exploit it.\n\nAttack Steps:\n- `attemptAbuse`, `attemptExploit`, `exploit`, `impact`: These steps represent the attack process, starting from attempting to abuse the vulnerability, employing an exploit, and eventually causing an impact on the system.\n- `networkAccessAchieved`, `localAccessAchieved`, `physicalAccessAchieved`, `lowPrivilegesAchieved`, `highPrivilegesAchieved`, `userInteractionAchieved`: These attack steps are used to satisfy the requirements specified by the defenses. They are used if the defense is not enabled or if the attacker is able to fulfill the requirement through their actions.\n- `inherentUserInteraction`: This attack step models the user interaction requirement for software vulnerabilities that require user interaction, even without the attacker's influence.\n\n**HardwareVulnerability**\n- Purpose: Represents a vulnerability that affects hardware, such as hardware systems or components.\n- Function: This asset defines several defenses and attack steps that help model the attack process, impact, and complexity of hardware vulnerabilities. The design of the HardwareVulnerability is similar to the SoftwareVulnerability, but it is not based on a vulnerability framework and is simplified compared to its software counterpart.\n\nDefenses:\n- `physicalAccessRequired`: This defense models the physical access requirement for exploiting a hardware vulnerability.\n- `confidentialityImpactLimitations`, `availabilityImpactLimitations`, `integrityImpactLimitations`: These defenses limit the impact on confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the hardware, respectively.\n- `effortRequiredToExploit`: This defense indicates that the vulnerability requires additional effort (time) from the attacker in order to be successfully exploited.\n\nAttack Steps:\n- `physicalAccessAchieved`: This attack step models the physical access requirement for exploiting a hardware vulnerability.\n- `impact`: This attack step represents the actual impact caused by successfully exploiting the hardware vulnerability.\n- `exploitTrivially`, `exploitWithEffort`: These attack steps are used to implement attacks of varying complexity based on the effort required to exploit the hardware vulnerability.\n\nAssociations:\n- `SoftwareVulnerability` and `HardwareVulnerability` are associated with `Application` and `SoftwareProduct` through the `vulnerabilities` association, respectively. This relationship indicates that an application or\n\nMAL Code:\n#id: \"org.mal_lang.Vulnerabilitylang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\ncategory Vulnerability {\n\n  abstract asset Vulnerability\n  user info: \"Vulnerability refers to the inability (of a system, application, etc.) to withstand the effects of a hostile environment.\"\n  {\n    # notPresent [Disabled]\n      user info: \"This defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nCategory Vulnerability in the Meta Attack Language (MAL) defines assets and the associated attack steps, defenses, and relationships for vulnerabilities in cybersecurity threat modeling. The Vulnerability asset serves as a base class, while SoftwareVulnerability and HardwareVulnerability are subclasses that further specify vulnerabilities affecting software and hardware, respectively.\n\n1. Vulnerability:\n   - Purpose: Represents the inability of a system or application to withstand the effects of a hostile environment.\n   - Components:\n     - `Vulnerability`: The base asset.\n     - `abuse`: The attacker tries to abuse a vulnerability in an asset. This leads to the `attemptExploit` attack step.\n     - `attemptExploit`: An intermediate attack step that allows for defenses. It leads to the `exploit` attack step.\n     - `exploit`: The attacker employs an exploit that makes use of this vulnerability. This leads to the `impact` attack step.\n     - `impact`: Each vulnerability has an impact on the vulnerable component, which can be of different levels.\n\n2. SoftwareVulnerability:\n   - Purpose: Represents a vulnerability that affects software (applications or software products).\n   - Components:\n     - `SoftwareVulnerability`: A subclass of Vulnerability that applies to software.\n     - Nine defenses (`networkAccessRequired`, `localAccessRequired`, `physicalAccessRequired`, `lowPrivilegesRequired`, `highPrivilegesRequired`, `userInteractionRequired`, `confidentialityImpactLimitations`, `availabilityImpactLimitations`, `integrityImpactLimitations`, and `highComplexityExploitRequired`) model the requirements that the attacker must fulfill to abuse the vulnerability according to the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) specification. If a defense is disabled, it means the SoftwareVulnerability does not require the attacker to fulfill that requirement.\n     - `inherentUserInteraction`: A defense that specifies the probability of user interaction on the given application.\n     - `attack steps`: Several attack steps (`networkAccessAchieved`, `localAccessAchieved`, `physicalAccessAchieved`, `lowPrivilegesAchieved`, `highPrivilegesAchieved`, `userInteractionAchieved`, `impact`, `attemptAbuse`, `attemptExploit`, `exploitTrivially`, `exploitWithEffort`, `read`, `modify`, `deny`, `application.read`, `application.modify`, `application.deny`, `softwareProduct.readApplications`, `softwareProduct.modifyApplications`) model the requirements and the actual impact caused by successfully exploiting the vulnerability.\n\n3. HardwareVulnerability:\n   - Purpose: Represents a vulnerability that affects hardware.\n   - Components:\n     - `HardwareVulnerability`: A subclass of Vulnerability that applies to hardware.\n     - Four defenses (`physicalAccessRequired`, `confidentialityImpactLimitations`, `availabilityImpactLimitations`, `integrityImpactLimitations`, and `effortRequiredToExploit`) model the requirements that the attacker must fulfill to abuse the vulnerability and the effort required to successfully exploit it.\n     - `attack steps`: Several attack steps (`physicalAccessAchieved`, `impact`, `attemptExploit`, `exploitTrivially`, `exploitWithEffort`, `read`, `modify`, `deny`, `hardware.read`, `hardware.modify`, `hardware.deny`) model the requirements and the actual impact caused by successfully exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements in the MAL Vulnerability category are as follows:\n\n- A Vulnerability can have defenses that specify the requirements for the attacker to abuse it.\n- If a defense is not enabled or if the attacker is able to fulfill the requirement, the corresponding attack step is executed.\n- The attack steps lead to the actual impact caused by exploiting the vulnerability.\n\nThe domain-specific implications of this MAL code are that it provides a standardized way to model vulnerabilities in cybersecurity threat modeling, allowing for the evaluation of the potential impact of\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory Vulnerability {\n\n  abstract asset Vulnerability\n  user info: \"Vulnerability refers to the inability (of a system, application, etc.) to withstand the effects of a hostile environment.\"\n  {\n    # notPresent [Disabled]\n      user info: \"This defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a new asset type called `SoftwareVulnerability` which represents a vulnerability that affects software products or applications. This vulnerability type is modeled to cover the 7 metrics of the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) version 3.1.\n\nThe MAL code includes several defenses and attack steps that help model these metrics:\n\n1. Network access, local access, physical access, low privileges, high privileges, user interaction, and exploit complexity are defined as defenses. These defenses specify the requirements an attacker needs to meet to exploit the vulnerability. If a defense is disabled, it means that the vulnerability does not require the attacker to fulfill that requirement.\n\n2. For each of the above defenses, there are corresponding attack steps that the attacker can perform to satisfy the defense's requirement. These attack steps are `networkAccessAchieved`, `localAccessAchieved`, `physicalAccessAchieved`, `lowPrivilegesAchieved`, `highPrivilegesAchieved`, `userInteractionAchieved`, and `highComplexityExploitRequired`.\n\n3. There is also an attack step called `inherentUserInteraction` that models user interaction requirements for vulnerabilities. This attack step is used when the user may fulfill the user interaction requirement through their regular activities without requiring the attacker to induce them to do so.\n\n4. The impact of the vulnerability is modeled through three attack steps: `read`, `modify`, and `deny`. These attack steps represent the disruptions based on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability scores, respectively.\n\n5. Additionally, there are two intermediate attack steps, `attemptAbuse` and `attemptExploit`, that allow for defenses and the implementation of attacks of varying complexity.\n\n6. The `attackWithEffort` and `exploitTrivially` attack steps are used to implement attacks of varying complexity based on the attack complexity CVSS score.\n\nThe logical flow of the MAL code is as follows:\n\n1. The attacker attempts to fulfill the requirements defined by the defenses (e.g., network access, user interaction).\n2. If the attacker succeeds in fulfilling a defense requirement, they move to the corresponding attack step (e.g., `networkAccessAchieved`).\n3. From there, they proceed to the impact attack steps (`read`, `modify`, or `deny`), which represent the disruptions based on the CVSS scores.\n4. If the vulnerability requires user interaction, `attemptAbuse` is triggered, and then `inherentUserInteraction` is executed, which may or may not result in user interaction fulfillment.\n5. If the attacker attempts to exploit the vulnerability, `attemptExploit` is executed, which determines the complexity of the exploit (`exploitTrivially` or `exploitWithEffort`).\n\nMAL Code:\nasset SoftwareVulnerability extends Vulnerability\n    user info: \"A vulnerability that affects software (i.e. Applications or SoftwareProducts).\"\n  {\n    /* The following 10 defenses are used to model the 7 metrics of the 3.1\n     * CVSS specification that we cover.

Identity and Access Management (IAM.mal)\n   - Purpose: Defines the identity and access management aspects of a system, including users, roles, and permissions.\n   - Function: Provides a way to model and analyze the identities and access control mechanisms within a system.\n   - Components:\n     - User: Represents a user within the system, with attributes such as name, role, and privileges.\n     - Role: Represents a role within the system, with assigned permissions and permissions that can be assumed.\n     - Permission: Represents a permission that grants access to a resource or action.\n\n4. Networking (Networking.mal)\n   - Purpose: Defines the network components and connections within a system, such as hosts, links, and network devices.\n   - Function: Provides a way to model and analyze the network infrastructure and communication paths within a system.\n   - Components:\n     - Host: Represents a network host, such as a server or router, with attributes such as IP address, MAC address, and operating system.\n     - Link: Represents a network link, such as a cable or wireless connection, with attributes such as bandwidth and type.\n     - NetworkDevice: Represents a network device, such as a switch or firewall, with attributes such as type and configuration.\n\n5. Vulnerability (Vulnerability.mal)\n   - Purpose: Defines the vulnerabilities that can be exploited in an attack, such as software bugs, misconfigurations, or weak passwords.\n   - Function: Provides a way to model and analyze the potential weaknesses within a system.\n   - Components:\n     - Vulnerability: Represents a vulnerability, with attributes such as name, description, and CVSS score.\n     - Exploit: Represents an exploit that can be used to take advantage of a vulnerability.\n     - AttackPattern: Represents a pattern of attack behavior, consisting of one or more steps and potentially involving multiple vulnerabilities and exploits.\n\nThe logical flow of the MAL code is determined by the associations between these components. Associations can be established using the following relationships:\n\n- Has: A resource has a specific attribute or is owned by a specific entity.\n- IsPartOf: A resource is a part of a larger resource or system.\n- Provides: A service is provided by a compute resource.\n- Contains: A data store contains one or more data resources.\n- Grants: A role grants a specific permission to a user.\n- Connects: Two network resources are connected by a network link.\n- Exploits: An exploit can be used to take advantage of a vulnerability.\n- Implements: An attack pattern implements one or more exploits or vulnerabilities.\n\nDomain-specific implications of the MAL code include the ability to model complex cybersecurity threat scenarios, analyze potential attack paths, and identify vulnerabilities and countermeasures. The modular structure of the language allows for easy customization and extension to specific domains or use cases.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.corelang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"ComputeResources.mal\"\ninclude \"DataResources.mal\"\ninclude \"IAM.mal\"\ninclude \"User.mal\"\ninclude \"Networking.mal\"\ninclude \"Vulnerability.mal\"", "type": "language"}}

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines and structures two types of assets - `UserAccount` and `Service`, with a subtype `RemoteDesktopUser`. The following is a detailed explanation of each asset, its components, and their relationships:\n\n1. `UserAccount`:\n   - Purpose: Represents user accounts on a system, including their privileges, credentials, and potential attacks.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks various attack steps, defenses, and associations related to user accounts.\n\n   Components:\n   - `userRights`: Collection of various rights and privileges associated with the user account.\n   - `userCredentials`: A collection of user credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or tokens.\n   - `userExecution`: A binary probability relation for executing malicious files or links.\n   - `userInformation`: A collection of sensitive user data that could be targeted for collection, including cached domain credentials, browsing data, and other information stored on the user's account.\n   - `userAccountManagement`: A set of operations aimed at managing user accounts, such as creating, modifying, or manipulating access tokens, accounts, and other related settings.\n\n   Logical flow and relationships:\n   - `userRights` provide the base privileges for the user account.\n   - `userCredentials` are used to gain access to the associated `userRights`.\n   - `userExecution` is a binary relation that allows for the execution of malicious files or links.\n   - `userInformation` contains sensitive data that could be targeted for collection.\n   - `userAccountManagement` operations are designed to manipulate user accounts and associated resources.\n\n   Domain-specific implications:\n   - The MAL code covers a wide range of common attacks related to user accounts, such as credential stuffing, remote desktop protocol exploitation, and privilege escalation.\n\n2. `RemoteDesktopUser`:\n   - Purpose: A subtype of `UserAccount` that specifically deals with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) user accounts.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks RDP-related attack steps, defenses, and associations for user accounts.\n\n   Components:\n   - `userCredentials`: A collection of RDP-related credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or tokens.\n   - `multiFactorAuthentication`: Focuses on bypassing or exploiting multi-factor authentication mechanisms related to RDP.\n\n   Logical flow and relationships:\n   - `userCredentials` are used to gain access to the associated `userRights`.\n   - `multiFactorAuthentication` operations are designed to bypass or exploit multi-factor authentication mechanisms related to RDP.\n\n3. `AdminAccount`:\n   - Purpose: Represents administrator accounts on a system, with an emphasis on their privileges, credentials, and potential attacks.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks various attack steps, defenses, and associations related to administrator accounts.\n\n   Components:\n   - `adminRights`: Collection of administrative privileges associated with the user account.\n   - `adminCredentials`: A collection of administrative credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or tokens.\n   - `attemptCreateAccount`: An attempt to create a hidden administrator account.\n   - `createAccount`: The process of creating a new account, either hidden or visible.\n   - `privilegedAccountManagement`: A set of operations aimed at managing administrator accounts, such as creating, modifying, or manipulating access tokens, accounts, and other related settings.\n\n   Logical flow and relationships:\n   - `adminRights` provide the base privileges for the administrator account.\n   - `adminCredentials` are used to gain access to the associated `adminRights`.\n   - `attemptCreateAccount` is an attempt to create a hidden administrator account.\n   - `createAccount` is the process of creating a new account, either hidden or visible.\n   - `privilegedAccountManagement` operations are designed to manipulate administrator accounts and associated resources.\n\n4. `Service`:\n   - Purpose: Represents services running on a system, including their potential attacks.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks various attack steps, defenses, and associations related to services.\n\n   Components:\n   - `attemptTrustedRelationship`: Attempt to exploit trusted third-party relationships for unauthorized access.\n   - `attemptUseThirdpartySoftware`: Att\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory Software {\n    asset UserAccount {\n        | userRights\n

The following is a detailed explanation of each asset, its components, and their relationships:\n\n1. `UserAccount`:\n   - Purpose: Represents user accounts on a system, including their privileges, credentials, and potential attacks.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks various attack steps, defenses, and associations related to user accounts.\n\n   Components:\n   - `userRights`: Collection of various rights and privileges associated with the user account.\n   - `userCredentials`: A collection of user credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or tokens.\n   - `userExecution`: A binary probability relation for executing malicious files or links.\n   - `userInformation`: A collection of sensitive user data that could be targeted for collection, including cached domain credentials, browsing data, and other information stored on the user's account.\n   - `userAccountManagement`: A set of operations aimed at managing user accounts, such as creating, modifying, or manipulating access tokens, accounts, and other related settings.\n\n   Logical flow and relationships:\n   - `userRights` provide the base privileges for the user account.\n   - `userCredentials` are used to gain access to the associated `userRights`.\n   - `userExecution` is a binary relation that allows for the execution of malicious files or links.\n   - `userInformation` contains sensitive data that could be targeted for collection.\n   - `userAccountManagement` operations are designed to manipulate user accounts and associated resources.\n\n   Domain-specific implications:\n   - The MAL code covers a wide range of common attacks related to user accounts, such as credential stuffing, remote desktop protocol exploitation, and privilege escalation.\n\n2. `RemoteDesktopUser`:\n   - Purpose: A subtype of `UserAccount` that specifically deals with Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) user accounts.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks RDP-related attack steps, defenses, and associations for user accounts.\n\n   Components:\n   - `userCredentials`: A collection of RDP-related credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or tokens.\n   - `multiFactorAuthentication`: Focuses on bypassing or exploiting multi-factor authentication mechanisms related to RDP.\n\n   Logical flow and relationships:\n   - `userCredentials` are used to gain access to the associated `userRights`.\n   - `multiFactorAuthentication` operations are designed to bypass or exploit multi-factor authentication mechanisms related to RDP.\n\n3. `AdminAccount`:\n   - Purpose: Represents administrator accounts on a system, with an emphasis on their privileges, credentials, and potential attacks.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks various attack steps, defenses, and associations related to administrator accounts.\n\n   Components:\n   - `adminRights`: Collection of administrative privileges associated with the user account.\n   - `adminCredentials`: A collection of administrative credentials, such as usernames, passwords, or tokens.\n   - `attemptCreateAccount`: An attempt to create a hidden administrator account.\n   - `createAccount`: The process of creating a new account, either hidden or visible.\n   - `privilegedAccountManagement`: A set of operations aimed at managing administrator accounts, such as creating, modifying, or manipulating access tokens, accounts, and other related settings.\n\n   Logical flow and relationships:\n   - `adminRights` provide the base privileges for the administrator account.\n   - `adminCredentials` are used to gain access to the associated `adminRights`.\n   - `attemptCreateAccount` is an attempt to create a hidden administrator account.\n   - `createAccount` is the process of creating a new account, either hidden or visible.\n   - `privilegedAccountManagement` operations are designed to manipulate administrator accounts and associated resources.\n\n4. `Service`:\n   - Purpose: Represents services running on a system, including their potential attacks.\n   - Function: Defines and tracks various attack steps, defenses, and associations related to services.\n\n   Components:\n   - `attemptTrustedRelationship`: Attempt to exploit trusted third-party relationships for unauthorized access.\n   - `attemptUseThirdpartySoftware`: Att", "output": "category Software {\n    asset UserAccount {\n        | userRights\n

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a cybersecurity threat model focused on hardware assets within a network. The primary asset defined is a computer, which can be infected, unresponsive, or have additional hardware additions. Each type of computer (Windows, Linux, MacOS) has specific attack steps that an adversary might take, such as attempting data exfiltration over USB, collecting audio or video, manipulating accounts, or deleting files.\n\nThe asset \"HardwareAddition\" extends the Computer asset and represents additional hardware components, such as computer accessories, computers, or networking hardware, that can potentially be introduced by adversaries to gain access.\n\nAnother key asset defined is a \"PeripheralDevice,\" which includes devices such as webcams, microphones, removable media, and any other peripherals connected to a computer system. These devices can be used for data collection (audio and video) or data exfiltration, and may also be infected with malware.\n\nSpecific peripheral devices such as webcams, removable media, and microphones are defined as subtypes of PeripheralDevice with their unique capabilities. For instance, removable media can collect sensitive data from the computer's operating system and exfiltrate data.\n\nThe MAL code also includes a logical flow for the attack steps.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe MAL code provided defines an asset named `UserAccount`. This asset is used to model a user account on a target system, and it encompasses various attack surfaces and associated threats.\n\nThe `UserAccount` asset consists of three primary components: `userRights`, `userCredentials`, and `userExecution`.\n\n1. `userRights`: This component represents the potential abuse of user rights by an attacker. It includes various actions such as elevating privileges, accessing sensitive information, and manipulating system settings.\n\n2. `userCredentials`: This component contains user credentials that are either valid or stolen, which can be used for further attacks. It includes user account information and credentials stored in various locations, such as files, databases, and memory.\n\n3. `userExecution`: This component focuses on executing malicious files or links, which can lead to the compromise of the user account.\n\nAdditionally, the asset has an optional component called `userInformation`, which includes data related to user training, user account management, and user account-related attacks.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code is based on the association between components. For example, `userCredentials` is associated with `userRights` and other attack surfaces. Similarly, `userExecution` is associated with `user.maliciousFile` and `user.maliciousLink`.\n\nSome domain-specific implications of this MAL code include the potential for attackers to exploit weak points in the system's user account management, such as inadequate privilege escalation controls, unsecured credentials, and vulnerable software. Attackers may also target user training vulnerabilities, such as phishing and spear-phishing attacks, to gain access to user accounts.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a comprehensive model for analyzing potential threats related to user accounts in a cybersecurity context.

{"mal_type": "asset"}, "raw": {"input": "The MAL code provided defines an asset named `UserAccount`. This asset is used to model a user account on a target system, and it encompasses various attack surfaces and associated threats.\n\nThe `UserAccount` asset consists of three primary components: `userRights`, `userCredentials`, and `userExecution`.\n\n1. `userRights`: This component represents the potential abuse of user rights by an attacker. It includes various actions such as elevating privileges, accessing sensitive information, and manipulating system settings.\n\n2. `userCredentials`: This component contains user credentials that are either valid or stolen, which can be used for further attacks. It includes user account information and credentials stored in various locations, such as files, databases, and memory.\n\n3. `userExecution`: This component focuses on executing malicious files or links, which can lead to the compromise of the user account.\n\nAdditionally, the asset has an optional component called `userInformation`, which includes data related to user training, user account management, and user account-related attacks.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code is based on the association between components. For example, `userCredentials` is associated with `userRights` and other attack surfaces. Similarly, `userExecution` is associated with `user.maliciousFile` and `user.maliciousLink`.\n\nSome domain-specific implications of this MAL code include the potential for attackers to exploit weak points in the system's user account management, such as inadequate privilege escalation controls, unsecured credentials, and vulnerable software. Attackers may also target user training vulnerabilities, such as phishing and spear-phishing attacks, to gain access to user accounts.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a comprehensive model for analyzing potential threats related to user accounts in a cybersecurity context. The model covers various attack surfaces, logical relationships, and domain-specific implications, making it valuable for threat modeling and security assessment purposes.", "output": "asset

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines an asset named `AdminAccount`, which represents a high-privileged account (such as an administrator account) on a system. The asset is characterized by the possession of administrative rights and user-specific properties like `user info`.\n\nThe asset `AdminAccount` consists of three components:\n\n1. `adminRights`: A list of potential attack steps that could be performed using the administrative privileges of the account, such as manipulating access tokens, modifying the registry, and executing various system services.\n\n2. `adminCredentials`: A set of associated components, including `adminRights`, valid account details, and remote services that the account can access.\n\n3. `attemptCreateAccount @hidden`: An attempt to create a hidden account, which is associated with the `createAccount` attack step.\n\nThe MAL code also includes two attack patterns:\n\n1. The `createAccount` pattern, which includes creating cloud accounts, domain accounts, and local accounts. This pattern is probabilistically modeled with an exponentially distributed rate (1440), meaning the attacker has a 0.05665 chance of attempting to create an account every 1440 units of time.\n\n2. `privilegedAccountManagement`: A pattern that represents various attack steps targeting privileged accounts, such as manipulating access tokens, exploiting remote services, and executing system services with elevated privileges. This pattern is probabilistically modeled with a more significant rate of 0.30.\n\nThe MAL code implies that an attacker with access to an administrator account can perform a wide range of destructive and information-gathering actions, including data destruction, data encryption, network sniffing, and privileged account management.

The model outlines various attack steps, defenses, and associations that an adversary may exploit or implement to compromise the browser and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.\n\n1. **Drive-by Compromise**: This attack step involves an adversary gaining access to a system through a user visiting a malicious website while browsing. Associated attack techniques include malvertising, cross-site scripting, service exploitation for client execution, gatekeeper bypass, and user execution.\n\n2. **Malvertising**: This attack step leads to the theft of application access tokens.\n\n3. **Cross-Site Scripting**: This attack step also leads to the theft of application access tokens.\n\n4. **Credentials from Web Browsers**: Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading specific files. This leads to the collection of user credentials.\n\n5. **Phishing**: Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information or gain access to victim systems. Associated techniques include spear-phishing attachments, spear-phishing links, and spear-phishing via service.\n\n6. **Spear-phishing Link**: This attack step involves social engineering text accompanied by a malicious link, requiring the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser.\n\n7. **Spear-phishing Attachment**: This attack step employs malware attached to an email, different from other forms of spear-phishing. It leads to the attempt to execute malicious files on the user's computer and the potential installation of a remote access trojan for persistence.\n\n8. **Browser Bookmark Discovery**: Adversaries may enumerate browser bookmarks to learn more about compromised hosts, potentially revealing personal information and internal network resources.\n\n9. **Install Extensions**: Once installed, browser extensions can browse to websites in the background, steal all information entered into a browser, and potentially serve as an installer for a remote access trojan for persistence.\n\n10. **Steal Web Session Cookie**: An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or services without the need for credentials.\n\n11. **Web Session Cookie**: After acquiring a valid cookie, adversaries can perform a Web Session Cookie technique to login to the corresponding web application, bypassing some multi-factor authentication protocols.\n\n12. **Update Software**: This defense may lead to a drive-by compromise.\n\n13. **Exploit Protection**: This defense may prevent a drive-by compromise.\n\n14. **Audit**: This defense inspects browser extensions.\n\n15. **Password Policies**: This defense applies to the collection of credentials from web browsers.\n\n16. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: This defense may prevent the theft of web session cookies.\n\n17. **Restrict Web-Based Content**: This defense blocks unknown or unused attachments by default that should not be transmitted over email, potentially preventing various attack steps, including spear-phishing attachments, links, and service exploits.\n\nThis MAL code provides a comprehensive threat model for a browser asset, outlining various attack paths and defensive measures to protect against potential threats.\n\nMAL Code:\nasset Browser {\n        & driveByCompromise //(0.37)]\n            user info: \"A drive-by compromise is when an adversary gains access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.\" \n            ->  malvertising,\n                crossSiteScripting,\n                service.os.computer.user.attemptUserExecution,\n                service.attemptExploitationForClientExecution,\n                service.os.attemptGatekeeperBypass\n\n\n        | malvertising //(9,0.167)]\n            ->  service.stealApplicationAccessToken\n\n        | crossSiteScripting //(0.32)*Exponential(1)]\n            ->  service.stealApplicationAccessToken\n\n        & credentialsFromWebBrowsers //(0.625)]\n            user info: \"Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.\"\n            ->  service.os.userAccount.userCredentials\n \n        | phishing\n            user info: \"Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems.\"\n            ->  attemptSpearphishingAttachment,\n                attemptSpearphishingLink,\n                service.attemptSpearphishingViaService\n\n        | attemptSpearphishingLink @hidden      \n            ->  spearphishingLink\n\n        & spearphishingLink\n            user info: \"The links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging User Execution.\"\n            ->  service.os.computer.user.attemptMaliciousLink\n            \n        | attemptSpearphishingAttachment @hidden      \n            ->  spearphishingAttachment\n      \n        & spearphishingAttachment\n            user info: \"Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a series of potential cybersecurity threats targeting the Windows operating system. The purpose of this MAL code is to model attacker behaviors and the techniques they might use to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and evade detection.\n\nThe MAL code consists of assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations. The asset defined in this MAL code is the Windows operating system.\n\nAttack steps are represented by various elements in the code, such as `attemptBypassUserAccessControl`, `exchangeEmailDelegatePermissions`, `at`, `appCertDLLs`, `appInitDLLs`, `accessibilityFeatures`, `BITSJobs`, `bootOrLogonAutostartExecution`, `bootOrLogonInitializationScripts`, `networkLogonScripts`, `clearWindowsEventLogs`, `cmstp`, `codeSigningCertificate`, `collectHashInformation`, `commandAndScriptingInterpreter`, `attemptComponentObjectModel`, `createOrModifySystemProcess`, `attemptDistributedComponentObjectModel`, `attemptControlPanel`, `componentObjectModelHijacking`, `componentFirmware`, `compiledHTMLFile`, `attemptCOR_PROFILER`, `credentialAPIHooking`, `credentialsInRegistry`, `dCShadow`, `dCSync`, `dynamicLinkLibraryInjection`, `portableExecutableInjection`, `threadExecutionHijacking`, `asynchronousProcedureCall`, `threadLocalStorage`, `deobfuscateOrDecodeFilesOrInformation`, `disableWindowsEventLogging`, `attemptDLLSearchOrderHijacking`, `dLLSideLoading`, `domainControllerAuthentication`, `attemptLSASSDriver`, `cachedDomainCredentials`, `eventTriggeredExecution`, `hideArtifacts`, `lSASecrets`, `hijackExecutionFlow`, `impareDefenses`, `indicatorRemovalOnHost`, `inputCapture`, `lateralToolTransfer`, `manInTheMiddle`, `masquerading`, `modifyAuthenticationProcess`, `mshta`, `msiexec`, `odbcconf`, `exchangeEmailDelegatePermissions`, `executeCode`, `attemptExecutionThroughAPI`, `executionThroughAPI`, `executionThroughModuleLoad`, `extraWindowMemoryInjection`, `fileAndDirectoryPermissionsModification`, `windowsFileAndDirectoryPermissionsModification`, `fileSystemLogicalOffsets`, `attemptFileSystemPermissionsWeakness`, `fileSystemPermissionsWeakness`, `forcedAuthentication`, `groupPolicyModification`, `groupPolicyPreferences`, `attemptGUIInputCapture`, `attemptHiddenWindow`, `imageFileExecutionOptionsInjection`, `indirectCommandExecution`, `installUtil`, `interProcessCommunication`, `invalidCodeSignature`, `serviceExhaustionFlood`.\n\nDefenses are not explicitly defined in the provided MAL code but can be inferred from the attack steps. For example, defensive measures such as user access control, antivirus software, host intrusion prevention, log analysis, and network intrusion detection would be effective counters to many of the attack steps defined in this MAL code.\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements in this MAL code are defined through associations such as `+>`, `->`, `&`, and `,`. For example, `attemptBypassUserAccessControl` is associated with `appCertDLLs` via `+>`, indicating that if the attacker attempts to bypass user access control, they may use appCertDLLs to achieve this goal. Similarly, `bootOrLogonInitializationScripts` is associated with `attemptLogonScripts` and `networkLogonScripts` via `->`, indicating that if the attacker attempts to establish persistence through boot or logon initialization scripts, they may use either logon scripts or network logon scripts to do so.\n\nDomain-specific implications of this MAL code relate to the Windows operating system and the various attack techniques that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and evade detection. Understanding these attack techniques is essential for developing effective cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigations.\n\nThe MAL code uses plain, professional language suitable for a technical audience. It avoids unnecessary repetition and vague summaries, providing precise and exhaustive descriptions of attack steps, their functions, and their implications.\n\nOverall, this MAL code models a wide range of potential attack techniques that an adversary might use to target the Windows operating system, providing a valuable resource\n\nMAL Code:\nasset Windows extends OS {\n        |

The purpose of this MAL code is to model attacker behaviors and the techniques they might use to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and evade detection.\n\nThe MAL code consists of assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations. The asset defined in this MAL code is the Windows operating system.\n\nAttack steps are represented by various elements in the code, such as `attemptBypassUserAccessControl`, `exchangeEmailDelegatePermissions`, `at`, `appCertDLLs`, `appInitDLLs`, `accessibilityFeatures`, `BITSJobs`, `bootOrLogonAutostartExecution`, `bootOrLogonInitializationScripts`, `networkLogonScripts`, `clearWindowsEventLogs`, `cmstp`, `codeSigningCertificate`, `collectHashInformation`, `commandAndScriptingInterpreter`, `attemptComponentObjectModel`, `createOrModifySystemProcess`, `attemptDistributedComponentObjectModel`, `attemptControlPanel`, `componentObjectModelHijacking`, `componentFirmware`, `compiledHTMLFile`, `attemptCOR_PROFILER`, `credentialAPIHooking`, `credentialsInRegistry`, `dCShadow`, `dCSync`, `dynamicLinkLibraryInjection`, `portableExecutableInjection`, `threadExecutionHijacking`, `asynchronousProcedureCall`, `threadLocalStorage`, `deobfuscateOrDecodeFilesOrInformation`, `disableWindowsEventLogging`, `attemptDLLSearchOrderHijacking`, `dLLSideLoading`, `domainControllerAuthentication`, `attemptLSASSDriver`, `cachedDomainCredentials`, `eventTriggeredExecution`, `hideArtifacts`, `lSASecrets`, `hijackExecutionFlow`, `impareDefenses`, `indicatorRemovalOnHost`, `inputCapture`, `lateralToolTransfer`, `manInTheMiddle`, `masquerading`, `modifyAuthenticationProcess`, `mshta`, `msiexec`, `odbcconf`, `exchangeEmailDelegatePermissions`, `executeCode`, `attemptExecutionThroughAPI`, `executionThroughAPI`, `executionThroughModuleLoad`, `extraWindowMemoryInjection`, `fileAndDirectoryPermissionsModification`, `windowsFileAndDirectoryPermissionsModification`, `fileSystemLogicalOffsets`, `attemptFileSystemPermissionsWeakness`, `fileSystemPermissionsWeakness`, `forcedAuthentication`, `groupPolicyModification`, `groupPolicyPreferences`, `attemptGUIInputCapture`, `attemptHiddenWindow`, `imageFileExecutionOptionsInjection`, `indirectCommandExecution`, `installUtil`, `interProcessCommunication`, `invalidCodeSignature`, `serviceExhaustionFlood`.\n\nDefenses are not explicitly defined in the provided MAL code but can be inferred from the attack steps. For example, defensive measures such as user access control, antivirus software, host intrusion prevention, log analysis, and network intrusion detection would be effective counters to many of the attack steps defined in this MAL code.\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements in this MAL code are defined through associations such as `+>`, `->`, `&`, and `,`. For example, `attemptBypassUserAccessControl` is associated with `appCertDLLs` via `+>`, indicating that if the attacker attempts to bypass user access control, they may use appCertDLLs to achieve this goal. Similarly, `bootOrLogonInitializationScripts` is associated with `attemptLogonScripts` and `networkLogonScripts` via `->`, indicating that if the attacker attempts to establish persistence through boot or logon initialization scripts, they may use either logon scripts or network logon scripts to do so.\n\nDomain-specific implications of this MAL code relate to the Windows operating system and the various attack techniques that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, maintain persistence, and evade detection. Understanding these attack techniques is essential for developing effective cybersecurity countermeasures and mitigations.\n\nThe MAL code uses plain, professional language suitable for a technical audience. It avoids unnecessary repetition and vague summaries, providing precise and exhaustive descriptions of attack steps, their functions, and their implications.\n\nOverall, this MAL code models a wide range of potential attack techniques that an adversary might use to target the Windows operating system, providing a valuable resource", "output": "asset Windows extends OS {\n        |

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a threat model for MacOS systems, focusing on various attack vectors and techniques used by adversaries to compromise and maintain persistence on a compromised system. Here's a breakdown of the major components:\n\n**Assets:** The main asset in this model is a MacOS system.\n\n**Attack Steps:** The attack steps include:\n1. Abuse Elevation Control Mechanisms: Attempt to bypass mechanisms designed to control privilege escalation.\n2. Account Manipulation: Attempt to manipulate accounts for maintaining access to credentials and permissions.\n3. Attempt Bash History: Search the bash command history for insecurely stored credentials.\n4. Attempt Bash_profile and Bashrc: Inject code into these files for persistence.\n5. Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Create or modify system-level processes for persistent malicious payload execution.\n6. Attempt Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization for persistence.\n7. Clear Mac System Logs: Clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion.\n8. Code Signing Certificate: Create, acquire, or steal code signing materials.\n9. Command and Scripting Interpreter: Abuse command and script interpreters for execution.\n10. Event Triggered Execution: Establish persistence and privilege escalation using system event triggers.\n11. Visual Basic: Abuse Visual Basic for execution.\n12. JavaScript or JScript: Abuse JavaScript/JScript for various behaviors, including hosting malicious scripts or downloading and executing them as secondary payloads.\n13. Attempt Clear Command History: Abuse command history to hide traces of intrusion and bypass log analysis.\n14. Create or Modify System Process: Create or modify system-level processes for persistent malicious payload execution.\n15. Credentials from Password Stores: Search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.\n16. Cron: Abuse the cron utility for task scheduling and persistent malicious code execution.\n17. Dylib Hijacking: Take advantage of ambiguous paths to plant dylibs for privilege escalation or persistence.\n18. Attempt Elevated Execution with Prompt: Leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.\n19. Attempt Emond: Use Event Monitor Daemon (emond) to establish persistence by scheduling malicious commands to run on predictable event triggers.\n20. File and Directory Permissions Modification: Modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists and access protected files.\n21. Execute Code: Execute malicious payloads.\n22. Attempt Gatekeeper Bypass: Bypass the built-in Gatekeeper check.\n23. Attempt GUI Input Capture: Capture user input for obtaining credentials.\n24. Hide Artifacts: Hide artifacts associated with behaviors to evade detection.\n25. Hijack Execution Flow: Execute malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.\n26. Indicator Removal on Host: Delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system.\n27. Input Capture: Use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials.\n28. Hidden Users: Hide user accounts to make them harder to find.\n29. Attempt Hidden Window: Hide running windows.\n30. HISTCONTROL: Operate without leaving traces by prepending a space to all terminal commands.\n31. Impare Defenses: Maliciously modify components of a victim environment to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.\n32. Infected OS: A compromised MacOS system.\n33. Invalid Code Signature: Attempt to mimic features of valid code signatures to deceive users, analysts, or tools.\n34. Kernel Modules and Extensions: Use loadable kernel modules to covertly persist on a system and evade defenses.\n35. Attempt Launch Agent: Install a new launch agent for persistent malicious code execution.\n36. Launch Agent: Create a launch agent that can be configured to execute at login using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories.\n37. Launchctl: Abuse launchctl functionality to execute code or bypass whitelisting if launchctl is an allowed process.\n38.

Here's a breakdown of the major components:\n\n**Assets:** The main asset in this model is a MacOS system.\n\n**Attack Steps:** The attack steps include:\n1. Abuse Elevation Control Mechanisms: Attempt to bypass mechanisms designed to control privilege escalation.\n2. Account Manipulation: Attempt to manipulate accounts for maintaining access to credentials and permissions.\n3. Attempt Bash History: Search the bash command history for insecurely stored credentials.\n4. Attempt Bash_profile and Bashrc: Inject code into these files for persistence.\n5. Boot or Logon Autostart Execution: Create or modify system-level processes for persistent malicious payload execution.\n6. Attempt Boot or Logon Initialization Scripts: Use scripts automatically executed at boot or logon initialization for persistence.\n7. Clear Mac System Logs: Clear system logs to hide evidence of an intrusion.\n8. Code Signing Certificate: Create, acquire, or steal code signing materials.\n9. Command and Scripting Interpreter: Abuse command and script interpreters for execution.\n10. Event Triggered Execution: Establish persistence and privilege escalation using system event triggers.\n11. Visual Basic: Abuse Visual Basic for execution.\n12. JavaScript or JScript: Abuse JavaScript/JScript for various behaviors, including hosting malicious scripts or downloading and executing them as secondary payloads.\n13. Attempt Clear Command History: Abuse command history to hide traces of intrusion and bypass log analysis.\n14. Create or Modify System Process: Create or modify system-level processes for persistent malicious payload execution.\n15. Credentials from Password Stores: Search for common password storage locations to obtain user credentials.\n16. Cron: Abuse the cron utility for task scheduling and persistent malicious code execution.\n17. Dylib Hijacking: Take advantage of ambiguous paths to plant dylibs for privilege escalation or persistence.\n18. Attempt Elevated Execution with Prompt: Leverage the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API to escalate privileges by prompting the user for credentials.\n19. Attempt Emond: Use Event Monitor Daemon (emond) to establish persistence by scheduling malicious commands to run on predictable event triggers.\n20. File and Directory Permissions Modification: Modify file or directory permissions/attributes to evade access control lists and access protected files.\n21. Execute Code: Execute malicious payloads.\n22. Attempt Gatekeeper Bypass: Bypass the built-in Gatekeeper check.\n23. Attempt GUI Input Capture: Capture user input for obtaining credentials.\n24. Hide Artifacts: Hide artifacts associated with behaviors to evade detection.\n25. Hijack Execution Flow: Execute malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs.\n26. Indicator Removal on Host: Delete or alter generated artifacts on a host system.\n27. Input Capture: Use methods of capturing user input for obtaining credentials.\n28. Hidden Users: Hide user accounts to make them harder to find.\n29. Attempt Hidden Window: Hide running windows.\n30. HISTCONTROL: Operate without leaving traces by prepending a space to all terminal commands.\n31. Impare Defenses: Maliciously modify components of a victim environment to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms.\n32. Infected OS: A compromised MacOS system.\n33. Invalid Code Signature: Attempt to mimic features of valid code signatures to deceive users, analysts, or tools.\n34. Kernel Modules and Extensions: Use loadable kernel modules to covertly persist on a system and evade defenses.\n35. Attempt Launch Agent: Install a new launch agent for persistent malicious code execution.\n36. Launch Agent: Create a launch agent that can be configured to execute at login using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories.\n37. Launchctl: Abuse launchctl functionality to execute code or bypass whitelisting if launchctl is an allowed process.\n38.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nIn this Meta Attack Language (MAL) code, we have a defined domain-specific language for cybersecurity threat modeling called \"examplelang\" version 1.0.0, categorized under the system domain. The purpose of this MAL code is to model a threat scenario involving network access, host authentication, user phishing, and password compromise.\n\nThe primary assets in this model are:\n\n1. **Network**: Represents a network infrastructure. It has a single access point that connects to hosts.\n\n2. **Host**: Represents a computer system or server within the network. It has three states: connect, authenticate, and guessPassword. The connect state is the initial state, and it allows the host to access the network. The authenticate state is reached after successful connection and requires valid credentials. The guessPassword state is an attempt to guess the password for successful authentication. The guessedPassword state is a generated event with an exponential rate of 0.02 that triggers the authenticate state.\n\n3. **User**: Represents a user attempting to access a host. It has two states: attemptPhishing and phish. The attemptPhishing state initiates a phishing attack, leading to the phish state. The phish state has an exponential rate of 0.1 and attempts to obtain user credentials from the passwords asset.\n\n4. **Password**: Represents a collection of user credentials (usually passwords). It has a single obtain event that allows the password to be used for host authentication.\n\nThe associations between assets define the relationships in the model:\n\n1. A network can have multiple network access points (NetworkAccess) that connect to multiple hosts.\n\n2. A host and a password can have a one-to-many relationship where multiple passwords can be associated with a single host.\n\n3. Similarly, a user and a password can have a one-to-many relationship where multiple passwords can be associated with a single user.\n\nThe logical flow of the model can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.

It has a single access point that connects to hosts.\n\n2. **Host**: Represents a computer system or server within the network. It has three states: connect, authenticate, and guessPassword. The connect state is the initial state, and it allows the host to access the network. The authenticate state is reached after successful connection and requires valid credentials. The guessPassword state is an attempt to guess the password for successful authentication. The guessedPassword state is a generated event with an exponential rate of 0.02 that triggers the authenticate state.\n\n3. **User**: Represents a user attempting to access a host. It has two states: attemptPhishing and phish. The attemptPhishing state initiates a phishing attack, leading to the phish state. The phish state has an exponential rate of 0.1 and attempts to obtain user credentials from the passwords asset.\n\n4. **Password**: Represents a collection of user credentials (usually passwords). It has a single obtain event that allows the password to be used for host authentication.\n\nThe associations between assets define the relationships in the model:\n\n1. A network can have multiple network access points (NetworkAccess) that connect to multiple hosts.\n\n2. A host and a password can have a one-to-many relationship where multiple passwords can be associated with a single host.\n\n3. Similarly, a user and a password can have a one-to-many relationship where multiple passwords can be associated with a single user.\n\nThe logical flow of the model can be summarized as follows:\n\n1.

Each of these assets has basic attack steps like access, read, write, delete, manipulate, and block signals.\n\nThe associations section defines relationships between assets, such as the relationship between IcsHardware and critical subsystems, redundant subsystems, safeguarded systems (SIS), signalSourceApp, signalDestApp, controlSignalSourceApp, controlSignalDestApp, sensor, data, sysSensor, actuator, dataActuator, sysActuator, synchronizedApp, encryptedSignal, containerSignal, and encryptCreds.\n\nIn summary, the MAL code defines a domain-specific threat modeling language for ICS systems, which allows analysts to model various attack scenarios, mitigation strategies, and relationships between assets in an ICS environment.\n\nMAL Code:\n#id: \"org.mal_lang.ICSlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"org.mal-lang.coreLang/coreLang.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/Controller.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/ControlServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/DataHistorian.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/EngineeringWorkstation.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/HMI.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/IOServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/SIS.mal\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

The language extends the core MAL language with specific assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations relevant to ICS systems.\n\nThe ICSlang category ComputeResources defines an asset named IcsHardware, which represents an ICS system with more attack vectors compared to the coreLang's System. This asset includes several attack steps, such as physical access, full access, loss of safety, loss of control, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control. These attack steps are further broken down into more specific attack steps to model various ICS attack scenarios.\n\nThe MAL code includes defense mechanisms such as module firmware verification, use of cryptography keys for firmware updates, use of authenticated firmware updates, and system firmware updates to mitigate specific attack steps.\n\nThe category DataResources defines assets like Signal, ControlSignal, IcsData, and IcsControlData, which represent data and control information sent over the ICS network. Each of these assets has basic attack steps like access, read, write, delete, manipulate, and block signals.\n\nThe associations section defines relationships between assets, such as the relationship between IcsHardware and critical subsystems, redundant subsystems, safeguarded systems (SIS), signalSourceApp, signalDestApp, controlSignalSourceApp, controlSignalDestApp, sensor, data, sysSensor, actuator, dataActuator, sysActuator, synchronizedApp, encryptedSignal, containerSignal, and encryptCreds.\n\nIn summary, the MAL code defines a domain-specific threat modeling language for ICS systems, which allows analysts to model various attack scenarios, mitigation strategies, and relationships between assets in an ICS environment.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ICSlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"org.mal-lang.coreLang/coreLang.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/Controller.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/ControlServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/DataHistorian.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/EngineeringWorkstation.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/HMI.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/IOServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/SIS.mal\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a category named `ComputeResources` that models different types of assets in an industrial control system (ICS) environment. These assets include ICS hardware, ICS applications, sensors, actuators, and synchronization modules.\n\n1. **ICS Hardware (IcsHardware)**: This asset extends the core `Hardware` class and represents hardware components in an ICS environment. It has several attack vectors such as physical access, full access, and specific access. The full access vector provides the attacker with control over the system, leading to potential loss of safety, loss of control, loss of view, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control. The system can also be shut down intentionally or unintentionally due to these attacks. There are several defense mechanisms proposed to mitigate these attacks, such as module firmware verification, using cryptography keys for firmware updates, and using authenticated firmware updates.\n\n2. **ICS Applications (IcsApplication)**: This asset extends the core `Application` class and represents software components in an ICS environment. It has specific access, full access, and normal operation vectors. The full access vector allows the attacker to manipulate the system, leading to restricted operation, manipulation of control, manipulation of view, loss of control, loss of view, and theft of operational information.\n\n3. **Sensor**: This asset generates data via a signal but may not have any associated software or host. An attacker with physical access can manipulate or block the signal, leading to manipulation of the data, loss of view, or manipulation of the system.\n\n4. **Actuator**: This asset consumes data from a signal but may not have any associated software or host. Manipulating or blocking the signal can lead to manipulation of the associated system or loss of control, respectively.\n\n5. **Synchronization Module**: This asset provides synchronization capabilities, such as a GPS receiver or a network-based synchronization module. It can be compromised, leading to manipulation of clock frequency, manipulation of time, or stopping the clock. These actions can further impact synchronized applications by causing manipulation of control, manipulation of view, loss of control, or loss of view.\n\nThe MAL code also includes various attack steps for each asset, explaining the logical flow and relationships between elements. These attack steps are propagated to parent systems, allowing for modeling of complex ICS environments with multiple layers of redundancy. The code also highlights domain-specific implications, such as MITRE ATT&CK ICS techniques, and provides suggestions for potential defenses.\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"mal_type": "category"}, "raw": {"input": "The provided MAL code defines a category named `ComputeResources` that models different types of assets in an industrial control system (ICS) environment. These assets include ICS hardware, ICS applications, sensors, actuators, and synchronization modules.\n\n1. **ICS Hardware (IcsHardware)**: This asset extends the core `Hardware` class and represents hardware components in an ICS environment. It has several attack vectors such as physical access, full access, and specific access. The full access vector provides the attacker with control over the system, leading to potential loss of safety, loss of control, loss of view, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control. The system can also be shut down intentionally or unintentionally due to these attacks. There are several defense mechanisms proposed to mitigate these attacks, such as module firmware verification, using cryptography keys for firmware updates, and using authenticated firmware updates.\n\n2. **ICS Applications (IcsApplication)**: This asset extends the core `Application` class and represents software components in an ICS environment. It has specific access, full access, and normal operation vectors. The full access vector allows the attacker to manipulate the system, leading to restricted operation, manipulation of control, manipulation of view, loss of control, loss of view, and theft of operational information.\n\n3. **Sensor**: This asset generates data via a signal but may not have any associated software or host. An attacker with physical access can manipulate or block the signal, leading to manipulation of the data, loss of view, or manipulation of the system.\n\n4. **Actuator**: This asset consumes data from a signal but may not have any associated software or host. Manipulating or blocking the signal can lead to manipulation of the associated system or loss of control, respectively.\n\n5. **Synchronization Module**: This asset provides synchronization capabilities, such as a GPS receiver or a network-based synchronization module. It can be compromised, leading to manipulation of clock frequency, manipulation of time, or stopping the clock. These actions can further impact synchronized applications by causing manipulation of control, manipulation of view, loss of control, or loss of view.\n\nThe MAL code also includes various attack steps for each asset, explaining the logical flow and relationships between elements. These attack steps are propagated to parent systems, allowing for modeling of complex ICS environments with multiple layers of redundancy. The code also highlights domain-specific implications, such as MITRE ATT&CK ICS techniques, and provides suggestions for potential defenses.", "output": "category ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

Here's an exhaustive but concise description of the structure and semantics of the MAL code:\n\n**Category DataResources**\n\nThis category contains several assets and attack steps related to data and signals in the context of ICS.\n\n**Assets:**\n\n1. **Signal:** Represents information that is transmitted between two assets, regardless of the medium. If data or information are transmitted over a known medium, use the IcsData or DataInTransit associations instead.\n\n2. **ControlSignal (extends Signal):** Represents control commands that are transmitted between two assets, regardless of the medium. If control commands are transmitted over a known medium, use the IcsControlData asset and the DataInTransit association instead.\n\n3. **IcsData:** Extends the coreLang's Data asset with One-Time (OT) attack vectors and directionality for non-control information. This data represents the non-control information sent over the OT network.\n\n4. **IcsControlData:** Extends the coreLang's Data asset with OT attack vectors and directionality for control information. This data represents the control information sent over the OT network.\n\n**Attack Steps:**\n\n- **attemptAccess:** Attempt to access the data. May fail if the 'dataNotPresent' defense is used.\n- **access:** Access the data, leading to attemptRead, attemptWrite, and attemptDelete.\n- **attemptRead, attemptWrite, attemptDelete:** Attempt to read, write, or delete the data, respectively.\n- **readContainedInformationAndData:** From the data, attempt to access also the contained information/data, if exists.\n- **manipulateSignal:** When an attacker sends a false or manipulated signal.\n- **blockSignal:** When an attacker blocks a signal from being sent/received.\n- **dataEncrypted:** If the data are encrypted, then accessing them requires the associated encryption credentials/key.\n- **authenticated:** If the data are authenticated, then modifying them is not possible.\n- **dataNotPresent:** Models the probability of data actually not existing on the connected container.\n- **encryptCreds:** Used to model the acquisition of encryption credentials necessary to access encrypted data.\n- **accessUnencryptedData:** Access the unencrypted data.\n- **accessDecryptedData:** Intermediate attack step to allow effects of 'accessUnencryptedData' on data after compromising the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled.\n- **read:** The attacker can read the data.\n- **write:** The attacker can write to the location of the data, effectively deleting it.\n- **delete:** The attacker can delete the data.\n- **manipulateSignal (for ControlSignal):** When an attacker sends a false or manipulated control signal.\n- **blockSignal (for ControlSignal):** When an attacker blocks a control signal from being sent/received.\n- **manipulationOfView:** The manipulation of view on the destination(s) when the data is manipulated or deleted.\n- **lossOfView:** The loss of view on the destination(s) when the data is not accessible (e.g., denied access or not present).\n- **manipulationOfControl:** The manipulation of control on the source(s) when the data is manipulated or deleted.\n- **lossOfControl:** The loss of control on the source(s) when the data is not accessible (e.g., denied access or not present).\n\n**Associations:**\n\n- **DataInTransit:** Not directly defined in the provided code, but it is mentioned as an alternative to use when data or information are transmitted over a known medium.\n\n**Logical Flow and Relationships:**\n\nThe attack steps are organized in a logical flow that reflects the process of accessing, reading, writing, and deleting data or control signals. The dataEncrypted and authenticated attack steps introduce conditions that may prevent access or modification of the data. The dataNotPresent attack step models the probability of data not existing on the connected container.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines an `IcsHardware` asset that extends the `Hardware` asset in the core language. This asset model is specific to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and includes additional attack vectors.\n\nThe `IcsHardware` asset has two main components: `moduleFirmware` and `systemFirmware`. Adversaries can potentially install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices (`moduleFirmware`) or exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware (`systemFirmware`).\n\nThe MAL code provides several defenses to mitigate these attack vectors:\n\n1. `moduleFirmwareVerification`: Verify the module's firmware from the main firmware upon boot-up or during normal operation.\n2. `useCryptographyKeyForFirmware`: Use a cryptographic key for firmware updates to make it harder to alter the firmware.\n3. `useAuthenticatedFirmwareUpdates`: Perform authentication of the source and data for firmware updates to prevent malicious alteration.\n\nThe `IcsHardware` asset can also be connected to a Safety Instrumented System (SIS), and if not connected, the safety mechanisms should be disabled (`sisConnected @hidden`).\n\nThe MAL code includes various attack steps, such as `lossOfSafety`, `shutdown`, `damageToProperty`, `lossOfControl`, `lossOfView`, `lossOfAvailability`, `lossOfProductivityAndRevenue`, `manipulationOfControl`, and `manipulationOfView`. These attack steps represent different ways an adversary can disrupt or manipulate the ICS system.\n\nIn addition, the code includes propagate attack steps for critical and redundant subsystems, which model the cascading effects of an attack on multiple subsystems. For instance, if any of the critical subsystems experience a shutdown, the parent system will also be shut down (`propagateCriticalShutdown`).\n\nFinally, the MAL code includes a `notDisabled` defense, which models the possibility of removing some IcsHardware used to provide redundancy. If a particular IcsHardware is not present, various attack steps can occur, such as `lossOfControl`, `lossOfView`, `lossOfAvailability`, `lossOfProductivityAndRevenue`, `manipulationOfControl`, `manipulationOfView`, and `shutdown`.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a structured and detailed model for threat modeling ICS systems, incorporating various attack vectors, defenses, and relationships between components.

Associations are defined using the `Association` construct and can be of different types like `Own`, `Impact`, `Prevent`, `Detect`, `Respond`, etc. Each association can have properties such as `source`, `target`, `type`, and `strength`.\n\nLogical Flow and Relationships:\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements in the MAL code describe the threat scenario for the ICS system. Assets are defined, and attack steps are associated with them to model potential vulnerabilities. Defenses are then defined and associated with the assets or attack steps to represent countermeasures in place. The `Association` construct is used to show the relationships between assets, attack steps, and defenses, indicating how they interact within the threat model.\n\nDomain-Specific Implications:\n\nThe ICS Lang MAL implementation is specific to Industrial Control Systems, focusing on modeling threats and vulnerabilities in this context. It includes component types, attack steps, and defenses relevant to the ICS domain, such as SCADA systems, HMI (Human-Machine Interface) vulnerabilities, and control system protocols.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a structured way to represent threat models for Industrial Control Systems, helping security professionals understand potential threats, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures in this domain.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal-lang.icsLang\"\n#version: \"0.0.2\"\n\ninclude \"icsLang.mal\"", "type": "language"}}

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nIn this Meta Attack Language (MAL) code, we have a category defined for a physical infrastructure system, with various assets, attack steps, and associations. The purpose of the MAL code is to model potential threats and attack paths in a physical industrial control system (ICS).\n\nHere's a summary of the components and their functionalities:\n\n1. **AccessPoint**: A physical or virtual interface connecting to other assets through a logical connection.\n\n2. **ActuatorCB**: Represents an actuator required to add attack steps from the actuator to a CircuitBreaker. The manipulate attack step can manipulate the circuit breaker's control, and the block attack step can cause a loss of control by blocking the circuit breaker.\n\n3. **CircuitBreaker**: Represents a physical component that can close or open a circuit.\n\n4. **Clock**: Represents an ICS application that attempts to connect to uninspected access points.\n\n5. **Equipment**: Represents any components that conduct electricity, including but not limited to circuit breakers.\n\n6. **Actuator**, **SubEquipment**, and **Transformer** are also equipment assets, but their specific purposes are not explicitly defined in this MAL code.\n\n7. **IEDHardware**, **IEDRouter**, **MU**, **RTU**, and **Server** are hardware assets. IEDHardware is a generic ICS hardware, IEDRouter has routing capabilities, MU merges analog signals and translates them to electronic signals, RTU is used for communication externally, and Server can reside in an IED, MU, or a substation, providing a platform for logical nodes.\n\n8. **LogicalDevice**, **LogicalNode**, **SubstationServer**, and **SubNetwork** are ICS applications. LogicalDevice contains logical nodes, SubstationServer is an IT server found in a substation, SubNetwork is a subnetwork defined in the IEC 61850 terminology, and LogicalNode enables the automation process by manipulating control and causing loss of control.\n\n9. **Function**, **SubFunction**, and **Gateway** are functional assets. Function represents any additional functions of the substation, SubFunction is a subpart of Function, and Gateway communicates externally and translates protocols.\n\nThe MAL code also defines various attack steps that can impact the system:\n\n1. **attemptPreemptiveShutdown**: Models the possibility of detecting a disruption and preemptively shutting down the system to prevent damage.\n2. **attemptPreemptiveShutdownOnSafetyLoss**: Models the possibility of detecting a loss of safety and preemptively shutting down the system due to concerns.\n3. **attemptShutdown**: Represents the preemptive shutdown operation.\n4. **attemptUnsafeState**: Models the possibility that a naturally occurring unsafe state is reached if there is a loss of control or view.\n5. **unsafeState**: Represents the system can only be damaged if it has reached an unsafe operating state.\n6. **lossOfSafety**: Represents the loss of safety due to adversaries' actions or consequences of their actions.\n7. **safetyMechanismsOffline**: Represents the case where physical assets should only be damaged if the safety mechanisms fail to shut down the system to prevent damage.\n8. **shutdown**: Represents the shutdown of the system due to preemptive shutdown operations, tampering, or safety shutdown procedures.\n9. **damageToProperty**: Represents the damage done to infrastructure, equipment, and the surrounding environment when attacking control systems.\n10. **lossOfAvailability**: Represents the disruption of essential components or systems to prevent owners and operators from delivering products or services.\n11. **lossOfProductivityAndRevenue**: Represents the loss of productivity and revenue due to disruptions and damage to control system operations, devices, and related processes.\n12. **lossOfControl**: Represents a sustained loss of control or a runaway condition in which operators cannot issue commands even if the malicious interference has subsided.\n13. **lossOfView**: Represents a sustained or permanent loss of view where the ICS will require local, hands-on operator intervention.\n14. **manipulationOfControl**: Represents the manipulation of control systems devices or the communication with and command of physical control processes.\n15. **manipulationOfView**: Represents the manipulation of the information\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory physical {\n\tasset AccessPoint extends ConnectionRule \n\tuser info: \"Asset taken from SCL.

This could potentially allow an attacker to control the flow of electricity or data through the circuit breaker.\n\n2. `block`: This attack step adds a loss of control over the circuit breaker, which would prevent the asset from functioning properly. This could disrupt the normal operation of the system or cause a failure.\n\nIt is important to note the difference in the relationships between these two components and the base `Actuator` asset's attack steps. The `+>` symbol indicates that the new attack steps are added on top of the parent asset's attack steps, while the `->` symbol would override the existing attack steps instead.\n\nIn the context of cybersecurity threat modeling, this MAL code represents a domain-specific implication for systems that rely on actuators and circuit breakers. By using `ActuatorCB`, analysts can model and analyze potential threats related to manipulating and disrupting the control flow of these critical components. The logical flow between the components is straightforward: an attacker can first manipulate the circuit breaker's control to gain unauthorized access or control, followed by a loss of control to disrupt the system's operation.\n\nIn summary, the `ActuatorCB` asset in the given MAL code serves to model actuators that interact with circuit breakers, allowing the addition of attack steps related to manipulating and blocking the circuit breaker's control.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nIn this Meta Attack Language (MAL) code, a system category is defined, with a specific focus on an Ethernet Gateway ECU (Ethernet Gateway Engine Control Unit).\n\n1. **Purpose**: The purpose of this MAL code is to model the behavior, capabilities, and vulnerabilities of an Ethernet Gateway ECU in a cybersecurity threat modeling context.\n\n2. **Components**:\n    - **Assets**: The primary asset in this model is the Ethernet Gateway ECU, which extends the GatewayECU. This asset has Ethernet network capabilities, allowing it to connect to other networks.\n    - **Attack steps**: The MAL code defines several attack steps, including `trafficVNetworks.adversaryInTheMiddle`, `forwarding`, `bypassFirewall`, `gatewayBypassIDPS`, `gatewayNoIDPS`, `trafficNetworks.accessNetworkLayer`, `trafficVNetworks.deny`, and `trafficNetworks.deny`. These steps represent various actions an attacker might take to compromise the Ethernet Gateway ECU or the networks it connects to.\n    - **Defenses**: The defense in this model is the `firewallProtection`. This defense represents the protection provided by a correctly configured firewall on the Ethernet Gateway ECU.\n    - **Associations**: The MAL code defines various associations between components using arrows (`->` and `+>`). These associations represent the logical flow of attacks and defenses.\n\n3. **Logical flow and relationships**: The Ethernet Gateway ECU can be accessed in multiple ways, such as through its vehicle and Ethernet networks. When the gateway receives traffic, it can either forward it or perform some level of processing, potentially leading to compromise. If the firewall is enabled, the attacker might bypass it, leading to further actions like bypassing the Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) and accessing the connected networks. If the firewall is disabled, the attacker can bypass it directly, leading to similar outcomes. The `firewallProtection` defense aims to prevent the bypassing of the firewall. The `deny` attack step represents a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on all connected networks.\n\n4. **Domain-specific implications**: This MAL code models the specific threat landscape of an Ethernet Gateway ECU, focusing on network-based attacks and the role of the firewall and IDPS as defenses. It highlights the potential for an attacker to bypass these defenses if they are disabled, emphasizing the importance of proper configuration and maintenance.\n\n5. **Plain, professional language**: The MAL code uses clear and concise technical terms to describe the components, relationships, and behavior in the model.\n\n6. **Avoid unnecessary repetition or vague summaries**: The MAL code is written in a manner that avoids unnecessary repetition and uses specific, descriptive terms for each component and action.

It has three attack steps:\n   - **physicalAccess**: Gaining physical access to the connector leads to access on the network layer.\n   - **connect**: This can be achieved by either bypassing connector protection (bypassConnectorProtection) or connecting without any protection (_connectNoProtection).\n   - **bypassConnectorProtection**: This attack step involves removing or bypassing objects that block the OBD connector, such as a protective plate or gaining access to the driver cabin. It requires effort and leads to physical access.\n   - **_connectNoProtection**: This attack step also leads to physical access, but no specific protective measures are mentioned.\n   - **connectorAccessProtection**: This is a defense mechanism that refers to any physical entity blocking attackers from physically connecting to the OBD-II port, such as a protective plate or a port placed in a hard-to-reach location.\n\n2. **ChargingPlugConnector**: This asset represents the charging plug on many electric vehicles, providing direct access to the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. Gaining physical access to the connector leads to access on the network layer of the connected network.\n\n3. **AftermarketDongle**: This asset represents an aftermarket device that connects to the OBD-II port, providing additional functionality to the vehicle's owner.\n   - **connectDongle**: When a dongle is connected, it leads to connecting to the network.\n   - **_connectToNetwork**: This attack step connects the dongle to the network, which then leads to connecting to the OBD-II connector.\n   - **dongleIsHardened**: This defense mechanism indicates that the firmware on the connected dongle cannot be modified by the attacker, preventing access on the network layer.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe `OBD2Connector` asset in the provided MAL code represents a modern OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) connector, which is commonly found in vehicles.\n\nThe `OBD2Connector` has the following components:\n\n1. `physicalAccess`: This component signifies gaining physical access to the OBD-II connector, which ultimately provides access to the network layer.\n\n2. `connect`: This is an action that leads to further attack steps. It consists of:\n   - `bypassConnectorProtection`: This action involves bypassing or removing items that block the OBD connector, such as a protective plate or gaining access to the driver cabin. This requires effort and is time-consuming, as indicated by the `Exponential(20.0)` modifier.\n   - `_connectNoProtection`: This action is similar to `bypassConnectorProtection`, but it does not specify the need to bypass any protective measures.\n\n3. `bypassConnectorProtection [Exponential(20.0)]`: This is a defense mechanism that prevents attackers from accessing the OBD-II port by blocking it with protective elements, such as a protective plate or placing it in a difficult-to-reach location. The `Exponential(20.0)` modifier signifies that the effort required to bypass this defense is high.\n\n4. `_connectNoProtection`: This is a defense mechanism that represents the absence of any objects blocking the OBD-II port, making it easily accessible for attackers.\n\n5. `connectorAccessProtection`: This is a defense mechanism that represents any type of physical entity blocking attackers from accessing the OBD-II port, such as a protective plate or the port being placed in a difficult-to-reach location.\n\nThe logical flow of the elements in the OBD2Connector asset is as follows:\n\n1. First, an attacker needs to gain `physicalAccess` to the OBD-II connector.\n2.

The language includes several categories, each representing a different aspect of the system: System, Networking, Communication, Security, and Associations.\n\nThe System category defines various asset types, including PhysicalMachine, SensorOrActuator, Machine, ECU, GatewayECU, VehicularApplication, Firmware, OperatingSystem, Service, Client, NetworkClient, VehicleNetworkReceiver, NetworkService, UDSService, TransmitterService, and FirmwareUpdaterService. Each asset represents a different component of the vehicle system, such as physical machines, sensors, actuators, ECUs, gateways, applications, services, and network clients.\n\nThe System category also defines attack steps that can be performed on these assets, such as connect, authenticate, bypassAccessControl, manipulate, deny, idControl, and machineAccess. These attack steps describe actions that an attacker can take to gain unauthorized access to assets, manipulate their behavior, or deny their services.\n\nThe Networking category defines VehicleNetwork, which represents vehicle networks like CAN bus, FlexRay, and LIN bus. It also defines several network-specific attacks, such as accessUninspected, accessNetworkLayer, eavesdrop, adversaryInTheMiddle, messageInjection, deny, _networkForwarding, _bypassIDPS, and _noIDPS.\n\nThe Communication category defines Dataflow, which represents channels that contain data in transit. It also defines ConnectionOrientedDataflow and ConnectionlessDataflow, which represent unicast/multicast and multicast/broadcast transmissions, respectively. This category also defines several data flow-related attack steps, such as eavesdrop, deny, adversaryInTheMiddle, request, respond, maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS, maliciousTransmit, eavesdropId, and eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection.\n\nThe Security category defines VehicularIdentity, VehicularCredentials, and MessageID, which represent identities, credentials, and message IDs, respectively.\n\nThe Associations category defines relationships between different components in the system, such as the relationship between machines and the applications that execute on them, the relationship between networks and data flows, the relationship between data flows and the data they transmit, and the relationship between IDPS and gateway ECUs.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several domain-specific implications, such as the fact that some assets extended from the coreLang, the fact that some attacks can be reached only from specific entry points or from GatewayEcu.fullAccess, and the fact that some attacks on specific networks may not be successful if only limited parts of the network's protocol are used.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a structured and comprehensive language for modeling threats to vehicle systems, allowing analysts to effectively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.\n\nMAL Code:\n// vehicleLang\n// Author: Sotirios Katsikeas (sotkat@kth.se)\n// Last major revision: July 2019\n\n//include \"vehicleLangEncryption.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLangEthernet.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLangPublicInterfaces.mal\"\n// All includes should be placed above this line, and not on included files for better tracebility.\n\ncategory System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

The language includes several categories, each representing a different aspect of the system: System, Networking, Communication, Security, and Associations.\n\nThe System category defines various asset types, including PhysicalMachine, SensorOrActuator, Machine, ECU, GatewayECU, VehicularApplication, Firmware, OperatingSystem, Service, Client, NetworkClient, VehicleNetworkReceiver, NetworkService, UDSService, TransmitterService, and FirmwareUpdaterService. Each asset represents a different component of the vehicle system, such as physical machines, sensors, actuators, ECUs, gateways, applications, services, and network clients.\n\nThe System category also defines attack steps that can be performed on these assets, such as connect, authenticate, bypassAccessControl, manipulate, deny, idControl, and machineAccess. These attack steps describe actions that an attacker can take to gain unauthorized access to assets, manipulate their behavior, or deny their services.\n\nThe Networking category defines VehicleNetwork, which represents vehicle networks like CAN bus, FlexRay, and LIN bus. It also defines several network-specific attacks, such as accessUninspected, accessNetworkLayer, eavesdrop, adversaryInTheMiddle, messageInjection, deny, _networkForwarding, _bypassIDPS, and _noIDPS.\n\nThe Communication category defines Dataflow, which represents channels that contain data in transit. It also defines ConnectionOrientedDataflow and ConnectionlessDataflow, which represent unicast/multicast and multicast/broadcast transmissions, respectively. This category also defines several data flow-related attack steps, such as eavesdrop, deny, adversaryInTheMiddle, request, respond, maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS, maliciousTransmit, eavesdropId, and eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection.\n\nThe Security category defines VehicularIdentity, VehicularCredentials, and MessageID, which represent identities, credentials, and message IDs, respectively.\n\nThe Associations category defines relationships between different components in the system, such as the relationship between machines and the applications that execute on them, the relationship between networks and data flows, the relationship between data flows and the data they transmit, and the relationship between IDPS and gateway ECUs.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several domain-specific implications, such as the fact that some assets extended from the coreLang, the fact that some attacks can be reached only from specific entry points or from GatewayEcu.fullAccess, and the fact that some attacks on specific networks may not be successful if only limited parts of the network's protocol are used.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a structured and comprehensive language for modeling threats to vehicle systems, allowing analysts to effectively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.", "output": "// vehicleLang\n// Author: Sotirios Katsikeas (sotkat@kth.se)\n// Last major revision: July 2019\n\n//include \"vehicleLangEncryption.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLangEthernet.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLangPublicInterfaces.mal\"\n// All includes should be placed above this line, and not on included files for better tracebility.\n\ncategory System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a set of assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations for modeling cybersecurity threats in the context of a vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs) and their interconnected networks.\n\nThe `System` category contains the following assets:\n\n1. `PhysicalMachine`: A base asset representing any physical machine. It has two attack steps, `connect` and `fullAccess`, with the latter leading to the `manipulate` attack step.\n\n2. `SensorOrActuator`: An asset representing physical machines like sensors and actuators. It extends `PhysicalMachine` and includes the same attack steps, with the addition of the `manipulate` step defining what an attacker can do once they have full access.\n\n3. `Machine`: An asset representing machines with higher complexity than simple actuators or sensors. It extends `Hardware` (not defined in the provided code) and includes the `connect`, `authenticate`, `bypassAccessControl`, `fullAccess`, `idControl`, `deny`, `_accessData`, `passFirmwareValidation`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`, and `gainNetworkAccess` attack steps.\n\n4. `ECU`: An asset representing any ECU/MCU/controller in a vehicle. It extends `Machine` and includes the `connect`, `maliciousFirmwareUpload`, `uploadFirmware`, `_ecuNetworkAccess`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`, `passFirmwareValidation`, `fullAccess`, `idControl`, `offline`, `shutdown`, `changeOperationMode`, `attemptChangeOperationMode`, `operationModeProtection`, `bypassMessageConfliction`, `_networkServiceMessageInjection`, `messageConflictionProtection`, `gainLINAccessFromCAN`, `GatewayECU`, and associated attack steps.\n\n5. `GatewayECU`: An asset representing a gateway/firewall ECU. It extends `ECU` and includes the `fullAccess`, `forwarding`, `bypassFirewall`, `gatewayBypassIDPS`, `gatewayNoIDPS`, `idpsExists`, `idpsDoesNotExist`, `deny`, and associated attack steps.\n\n6. `VehicularApplication`, `Firmware`, `OperatingSystem`, `Service`, `Client`, `NetworkClient`, `VehicleNetworkReceiver`, `NetworkService`, `UDSService`, `TransmitterService`, and `FirmwareUpdaterService`: These are abstract assets representing various types of applications, services, and network components in a vehicle. They are extended or defined further in the code, but are left empty or intentionally blank.\n\nThe MAL code defines various attack steps, such as `connect`, `authenticate`, `bypassAccessControl`, `manipulate`, `deny`, `attemptRead`, `attemptWrite`, `attemptDelete`, `maliciousFirmwareModification`, `crackFirmwareValidation`, `bypassSecureBoot`, and `serviceMessageInjection`. These steps outline different ways an attacker can interact with the defined assets, such as gaining access, manipulating data, or performing denial of service attacks.\n\nDefenses are modeled as well, such as `firewallProtection`, `messageConflictionProtection`, `secureBoot`, and `udsSecurityAccess`. These defenses represent protective mechanisms like firewalls, message confliction protection, secure boot, and authentication protocols that the system can employ to prevent or mitigate attacks.\n\nAssociations between assets and attack steps are established using the `->` operator, which implies a straightforward relationship. The `+>` operator, on the other hand, signifies that an attack step requires the successful completion of the prerequisite steps. For example, the `fullAccess` attack step for a `Machine` requires either a successful authentication or a bypass of access control.\n\nThe MAL code also includes probabilistic attack steps marked with the `Exponential(X)` annotation, where `X` is a probability value between 0 and 1. These steps represent attacks that have a certain success rate.\n\nIn summary, this MAL code defines a structured language for modeling threat scenarios in the context of automotive systems, allowing analysts to understand, analyze, and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats to vehicle networks and ECUs.\n\nMAL Code:\ncategory System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

It has two attack steps, `connect` and `fullAccess`, with the latter leading to the `manipulate` attack step.\n\n2. `SensorOrActuator`: An asset representing physical machines like sensors and actuators. It extends `PhysicalMachine` and includes the same attack steps, with the addition of the `manipulate` step defining what an attacker can do once they have full access.\n\n3. `Machine`: An asset representing machines with higher complexity than simple actuators or sensors. It extends `Hardware` (not defined in the provided code) and includes the `connect`, `authenticate`, `bypassAccessControl`, `fullAccess`, `idControl`, `deny`, `_accessData`, `passFirmwareValidation`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`, and `gainNetworkAccess` attack steps.\n\n4. `ECU`: An asset representing any ECU/MCU/controller in a vehicle. It extends `Machine` and includes the `connect`, `maliciousFirmwareUpload`, `uploadFirmware`, `_ecuNetworkAccess`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`, `passFirmwareValidation`, `fullAccess`, `idControl`, `offline`, `shutdown`, `changeOperationMode`, `attemptChangeOperationMode`, `operationModeProtection`, `bypassMessageConfliction`, `_networkServiceMessageInjection`, `messageConflictionProtection`, `gainLINAccessFromCAN`, `GatewayECU`, and associated attack steps.\n\n5. `GatewayECU`: An asset representing a gateway/firewall ECU. It extends `ECU` and includes the `fullAccess`, `forwarding`, `bypassFirewall`, `gatewayBypassIDPS`, `gatewayNoIDPS`, `idpsExists`, `idpsDoesNotExist`, `deny`, and associated attack steps.\n\n6. `VehicularApplication`, `Firmware`, `OperatingSystem`, `Service`, `Client`, `NetworkClient`, `VehicleNetworkReceiver`, `NetworkService`, `UDSService`, `TransmitterService`, and `FirmwareUpdaterService`: These are abstract assets representing various types of applications, services, and network components in a vehicle. They are extended or defined further in the code, but are left empty or intentionally blank.\n\nThe MAL code defines various attack steps, such as `connect`, `authenticate`, `bypassAccessControl`, `manipulate`, `deny`, `attemptRead`, `attemptWrite`, `attemptDelete`, `maliciousFirmwareModification`, `crackFirmwareValidation`, `bypassSecureBoot`, and `serviceMessageInjection`. These steps outline different ways an attacker can interact with the defined assets, such as gaining access, manipulating data, or performing denial of service attacks.\n\nDefenses are modeled as well, such as `firewallProtection`, `messageConflictionProtection`, `secureBoot`, and `udsSecurityAccess`. These defenses represent protective mechanisms like firewalls, message confliction protection, secure boot, and authentication protocols that the system can employ to prevent or mitigate attacks.\n\nAssociations between assets and attack steps are established using the `->` operator, which implies a straightforward relationship. The `+>` operator, on the other hand, signifies that an attack step requires the successful completion of the prerequisite steps. For example, the `fullAccess` attack step for a `Machine` requires either a successful authentication or a bypass of access control.\n\nThe MAL code also includes probabilistic attack steps marked with the `Exponential(X)` annotation, where `X` is a probability value between 0 and 1. These steps represent attacks that have a certain success rate.\n\nIn summary, this MAL code defines a structured language for modeling threat scenarios in the context of automotive systems, allowing analysts to understand, analyze, and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats to vehicle networks and ECUs.", "output": "category System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a threat modeling language for cybersecurity, specifically focusing on communication channels and data flows within a system. The language differentiates between two types of data flows: Connection Oriented Dataflow and Connectionless Dataflow.\n\n1. Dataflow: This is a general channel that contains data in transit. It has several attack steps:\n   - eavesdrop: An attacker can access the data, and if it's encrypted, confidentiality might not be breached.\n   - deny: A denial-of-service attack makes the data inaccessible, but the information may still be available elsewhere.\n   - adversaryInTheMiddle: An attacker controls the data, but if it's encrypted and authenticated, confidentiality and integrity are maintained.\n   - request and respond: These steps represent normal communication flows.\n   - maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, and maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS: These represent malicious activities, with the latter two bypassing IDPS and confliction protection mechanisms.\n   - eavesdropId: The attacker eavesdrops and reads the unique ID of the message.\n   - eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection: The attacker eavesdrops, reads the unique ID, and bypasses the confliction protection mechanism.\n\n2. Connection Oriented Dataflow: This is a unicast or multicast transmission that contains data in transit. It includes all the attack steps from the Dataflow asset, plus additional ones:\n   - request: Initiates a network connection without inspection.\n   - respond: Responds to a network connection without inspection.\n   - maliciousRespond: A malicious response that may take time to bypass the confliction protection mechanism.\n\n3. Connectionless Dataflow: This is a multicast or broadcast transmission that contains data in transit. It includes all the attack steps from the Dataflow asset, plus additional ones:\n   - eavesdrop: An attacker can access the data, and if it's encrypted, confidentiality might not be breached.\n   - adversaryInTheMiddle: An attacker controls the data, but if it's encrypted and authenticated, confidentiality and integrity are maintained.\n   - maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, and maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS: These represent malicious activities, with the latter two bypassing IDPS and confliction protection mechanisms.\n   - maliciousTransmit: The act of trying to maliciously transmit. This happens when IDPS is not in place so the attacker can make malicious transmissions unobstructed.\n   - transmit: The result of a successful transmit.\n   - eavesdropId and eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection: These represent the attacker eavesdropping and reading the unique ID of the message, with the latter bypassing the confliction protection mechanism.\n\nIn a broadcast network, there is no need for clients because everyone receives the message.

It includes all the attack steps from the Dataflow asset, plus additional ones:\n   - request: Initiates a network connection without inspection.\n   - respond: Responds to a network connection without inspection.\n   - maliciousRespond: A malicious response that may take time to bypass the confliction protection mechanism.\n\n3. Connectionless Dataflow: This is a multicast or broadcast transmission that contains data in transit. It includes all the attack steps from the Dataflow asset, plus additional ones:\n   - eavesdrop: An attacker can access the data, and if it's encrypted, confidentiality might not be breached.\n   - adversaryInTheMiddle: An attacker controls the data, but if it's encrypted and authenticated, confidentiality and integrity are maintained.\n   - maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, and maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS: These represent malicious activities, with the latter two bypassing IDPS and confliction protection mechanisms.\n   - maliciousTransmit: The act of trying to maliciously transmit. This happens when IDPS is not in place so the attacker can make malicious transmissions unobstructed.\n   - transmit: The result of a successful transmit.\n   - eavesdropId and eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection: These represent the attacker eavesdropping and reading the unique ID of the message, with the latter bypassing the confliction protection mechanism.\n\nIn a broadcast network, there is no need for clients because everyone receives the message.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis MAL code defines a \"Machine\" asset, which represents a machine with higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor. The asset extends from the coreLang and has several attack steps, defenses, and associations.\n\n1. `connect`: The purpose of this attack step is to attempt to connect to the machine. It requires authenticated access, connect privileges, and can exploit connection vulnerabilities.\n\n2. `authenticate`: This attack step checks if the attacker has the credentials of an identity to gain access to the machine. It requires authenticated access.\n\n3. `authenticatedAccess`: This is a way to gain access to the machine through legitimate authentication. It leads to full access.\n\n4. `bypassAccessControl`: An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine with a small probability (0.02). It leads to full access.\n\n5. `fullAccess`: Full access is not explicitly modeled as a sound primitive but can be modeled as an identity with access to all machineExecutedApps and all data.\n\n6. `idControl`: This attack step is used when ID is compromised from dataflow.\n\n7. `_machineAccess`: This is a helper attack step that also serves as a starting point for other child assets of the machine. It leads to deny, access data, machineExecutedApps' local connect, and access vulnerabilities exploit.\n\n8. `deny`: This attack step performs a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the machine, denying access to machineExecutedApps and hostedData.\n\n9. `_accessData`: This is a helper attack step to request access on data stored on the machine, leading to attempted read, write, and delete on hostedData.\n\n10. `passFirmwareValidation`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`: These are blank helper attack steps that will be used from the childs of the asset.\n\n11. `gainNetworkAccess`: This attack step is specific to the infotainment system asset.\n\nThe logical flow starts with the `connect` step, which requires authenticated access, connect privileges, and can exploit connection vulnerabilities. If the attacker has the credentials (`authenticate`), they gain authenticated access, which eventually leads to full access (`authenticatedAccess` or `bypassAccessControl`).

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a specialized asset class for an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which is a common controller found in vehicles. This asset class includes various attack steps, defenses, and associations to model potential threats and countermeasures in a vehicle network.\n\nThe ECU asset extends the existing `Machine` class because the original class had many unrelated attacks. The purpose of the ECU asset is to create a new parent class that accurately represents the specific attacks and connections relevant to ECUs, MCUs, or controllers.\n\n1. **Connect**: This attack step allows attackers to attempt connecting to the ECU and potentially change the operation mode if they have access to the network, services, dataflows, etc. It leads to the `attemptChangeOperationMode` attack step.\n\n2. **MaliciousFirmwareUpload**: By uploading a forged firmware, the attacker gains full access to the ECU and can inject/eavesdrop messages on the previous running services and network.\n\n3. **uploadFirmware**: Uploading firmware leads to full access on the ECU and the ability to inject/eavesdrop messages. This is a less malicious version of `maliciousFirmwareUpload`, assuming the firmware is not forged.\n\n4. **_ecuNetworkAccess**: This is a helper attack step, as both `maliciousFirmwareUpload` and `uploadFirmware` lead to the same connections. It provides access to various network-related attacks, such as eavesdropping, message injection, and specific J1939 attacks.\n\n5. **udsFirmwareModification** and **passUdsFirmwareModification**: These attack steps are reached after gaining access to the FirmwareUpdaterService. The difference between the two is that `passUdsFirmwareModification` assumes the attacker has the cryptographic key.\n\n6. **passFirmwareValidation**: If the firmware validation key is stored in the ECU, this means that the firmware validation is passed, and a new firmware can be uploaded. It leads to the `uploadFirmware` attack step.\n\n7. **fullAccess**: Attackers have full access to the ECU if they have compromised its firmware, bypassed access control, or properly authenticated themselves. This access grants the ability to manipulate connected sensors or actuators, change the operation mode, gain access to the LIN bus, bypass message conflictions, and access the ECU network.\n\n8. **idControl**: Compromising the ECU's ID allows an attacker to manipulate connected sensors or actuators.\n\n9. **offline**: When the ECU is taken offline, it's still powered on but unable to communicate on its bus. The connected sensors or actuators can be manipulated.\n\n10. **shutdown**: When the ECU is powered off, the attacker-initiated denial of service affects data and machineExecutedApps.\n\n11. **changeOperationMode**: This attack step puts the ECU into diagnostics or update mode, bypassing message conflictions and IDPS. It leads to the `shutdown` attack step, as the attacker must have achieved access to the ECU to reach this stage.\n\n12. **attemptChangeOperationMode**: Similar to `changeOperationMode`, but it requires some effort and results in the ECU being offline.\n\n13. **operationModeProtection** and **messageConflictionProtection**: These are defenses intended to prevent unauthorized changes to the operation mode or to protect against message injection, respectively. They are based on research by Charlie Miller, Chris Valasek, Pierre Kleberger, Tomas Olovsson, Erland Jonsson, and Junko Takahashi et al.\n\n14. **bypassMessageConfliction**: This attack step bypasses message confliction protection mechanisms by changing the ECU's operation mode, enabling service message injection.\n\n15. **_networkServiceMessageInjection**: Injecting forged service messages can notify about vehicle faults or report false status, potentially leading to an unresponsive ECU (TPMS). This attack is reached from network access.\n\n16. **gainLINAccessFromCAN**: This attack step involves gaining access to the LIN bus through a CAN-bus node. It should occur with a probability and not always.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis MAL code defines a specialized component, `GatewayECU`, which represents a gateway/firewall device in a vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU) network. The purpose of this component is to act as a protective barrier against cyber threats, specifically by allowing or denying traffic based on configured rules.\n\nThe `GatewayECU` has several key components:\n\n1. `fullAccess`: This allows the ECU to have full access to the traffic on the vehicle's networks (`trafficVNetworks`) and to override any default access control settings.\n\n2. `forwarding`: This component represents the gateway's basic function of forwarding traffic. It allows traffic to flow through the gateway, potentially leading to compromise of the gateway and any associated firewall. This, in turn, results in the `connect` attack step.\n\n3. `bypassFirewall`: This component represents an attacker bypassing the gateway's firewall protection. If the firewall is disabled, the attacker can proceed to other attack steps, including `gatewayBypassIDPS`, `gatewayNoIDPS`, and `trafficVNetworks.accessUDSservices`.\n\n4. `firewallProtection`: This defense mechanism ensures that the gateway's firewall is properly configured and functional.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThe provided MAL code defines a specific threat model for a vehicles' electronic control unit (ECU) firmware, focusing on potential attacks and defenses related to firmware updates and Secure Boot validation.\n\nThe asset in this MAL code is `Firmware`, which extends the base `VehicularApplication` class. This specifies the firmware running on an ECU as an application.\n\nThe threat model includes several attack steps:\n\n1. `maliciousFirmwareModification`: This attack attempts to perform a firmware update by either bypassing or cracking Secure Boot. It involves two sub-attacks: `bypassSecureBoot` and `crackSecureBoot`.\n\n2. `crackFirmwareValidation`: This attack attempts to crack firmware validation if it is enabled. It is associated with the `hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload` attack.\n\n3. `bypassFirmwareValidation`: This attack bypasses firmware validation if it is not enabled and is also associated with the `hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload` attack.\n\nThe model also includes a defense mechanism: `firmwareValidation`. This defense mechanism includes code signing and verification during upload, use of strong checksum functions, and the non-distribution of private keys for signing. It aims to prevent the `bypassFirmwareValidation` attack.\n\nAdditionally, the model includes another defense mechanism: `secureBoot`. Secure Boot is a protection mechanism that validates the boot software and the firmware at system boot time. This mechanism is expected to make running of forged firmware harder when enabled, thus stopping the `bypassSecureBoot` and `crackSecureBoot` attacks.\n\nThe logical flow in this model is as follows:\n\n1. If Secure Boot is enabled, the attacker can either bypass it (`bypassSecureBoot`) or try to crack it (`crackSecureBoot`).\n2. If Secure Boot is not enabled, the attacker can directly bypass firmware validation (`bypassFirmwareValidation`).\n3.

It has two sub-attacks:\n   - `busOffAttack`: This attack exploits the error-handling scheme of in-vehicle networks to disconnect good/uncompromised Electronic Control Units (ECUs) or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the entire network. This attack is applicable to both traditional CAN and CAN-FD networks.\n   - `exploitArbitration`: This attack exploits the arbitration mechanism for message prioritization in CAN bus networks. By doing so, it can lead to the invalidation of legitimate messages, causing a Denial of Service, and allow message tampering or injection.\n\n2. `deny`: This is a general defense mechanism that blocks the communication of messages on the network. It can be applied in response to any attack.\n\n3. `dataflows.maliciousTransmit`: This dataflow allows the transmission of malicious messages on the network, differentiating it from the `messageInjection` attack.

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nIn this Meta Attack Language (MAL) code, we define a series of attack steps and components related to a connectionless dataflow in a network, particularly in a broadcast or event-driven network like CAN (Controller Area Network). The main focus is on potential threats and countermeasures for unauthorized access, data manipulation, and transmission.\n\nThe primary asset in this MAL code is the \"connectionless dataflow,\" which represents a multicast or broadcast transmission containing data in transit. This dataflow can be intercepted and manipulated by an attacker.\n\nAttack steps defined in this MAL code include:\n\n1. `eavesdrop`: An attacker listens to the dataflow, potentially gaining access to the contained data (which may or may not be encrypted).\n2. `adversaryInTheMiddle`: An attacker takes control of the dataflow, enabling them to manipulate the data (which may be encrypted and authenticated). This attacker can read, write, delete, or transmit the data. This attack is difficult to detect by Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).\n3. `maliciousTransmitNoIDPS`: A malicious transmission is performed when IDPS is disabled on GatewayECU. The attacker must bypass the message confliction mechanism to achieve this.\n4. `maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection`: The attacker manages to bypass the confliction protection mechanism, allowing them to transmit malicious data. This process typically takes some time.\n5. `maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS`: The attacker manages to bypass the IDPS system, allowing them to transmit malicious data. The time required to bypass a well-tuned and updated IDPS is studied in references provided in the code.\n6. `maliciousTransmit`: The act of trying to transmit maliciously, which occurs when IDPS is not in place, allowing the attacker to make malicious transmissions unobstructed.\n7. `transmit`: The successful transmission of data through the network.\n\nAssociations between these attack steps and components are defined using the `->` and `+>` operators, which represent sequential and parallel relationships, respectively. The `&` operator defines conjunctive relationships between attack steps.\n\nFor example, the `adversaryInTheMiddle` attack step is a combination of the `eavesdrop` and other manipulative actions (`deny`, `data.write`, `data.read`, `data.delete`, and `transmit`).

{"embedding_input": "Description:\nThis MAL code describes various components and their relationships in a cybersecurity threat model for a vehicular network. The components include:\n\n1. **Machine**: Represents a machine in the vehicular network. Each machine can have one or no host machine, one or more machine-executed apps, and one or more connection or access vulnerabilities.\n\n2. **VehicularIdentity**: Represents a privilege granted to a machine. There are three types: user info, connect privileges, and assigned vehicular identity. The user info privilege grants access to the machine, while connect privileges are granted to anyone who connects to a machine. Assigned vehicular identity is a privilege associated with a specific application.\n\n3. **VehicularApplication**: Represents an application in the vehicular network. It can be assigned one or more vehicular identities.\n\n4. **VehicleNetwork**: Represents a network in the vehicular network. Each network can communicate with multiple dataflows.\n\n5. **J1939Network**: A specific type of network that uses connection-oriented dataflows for communication.\n\n6. **Dataflow**: Represents a data transmission between network elements. Each dataflow transmits one data item and can be either connection-oriented or connectionless. Connectionless dataflows can have multiple transmitters and receivers.\n\n7. **IDPS**: Represents an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) that is connected to a GatewayECU.\n\n8. **Vulnerability**: Represents a weakness in a machine or network that can be exploited by an attacker. There are two types: connection vulnerability and access vulnerability.\n\n9. **ECU**: Represents an Electronic Control Unit in the vehicular network. Each ECU can have one or more firmware running on it, one or more firmware updater services, and one or more sensors or actuators.\n\n10. **Firmware**: Represents the software running on an ECU.\n\n11. **FirmwareUpdaterService**: Represents a service responsible for handling firmware updates on an ECU.\n\n12. **SensorOrActuator**: Represents a physical machine connected to an ECU, such as an actuator or sensor.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code shows the relationships between these components. For example, an application needs certain privileges to execute on a platform (vehicular identity), and when the application is compromised, the attacker gains its privileges on the platform. Dataflows are used for communication between network elements, and each dataflow transmits one data item. IDPS is connected to a GatewayECU for intrusion detection and prevention.
