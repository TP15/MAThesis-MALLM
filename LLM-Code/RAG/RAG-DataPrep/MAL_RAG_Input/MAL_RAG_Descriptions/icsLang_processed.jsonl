{"input": "This MAL code defines a threat modeling language for Industrial Control Systems (ICS) called ICSlang. The language extends the core MAL language with specific assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations relevant to ICS systems.\n\nThe ICSlang category ComputeResources defines an asset named IcsHardware, which represents an ICS system with more attack vectors compared to the coreLang's System. This asset includes several attack steps, such as physical access, full access, loss of safety, loss of control, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control. These attack steps are further broken down into more specific attack steps to model various ICS attack scenarios.\n\nThe MAL code includes defense mechanisms such as module firmware verification, use of cryptography keys for firmware updates, use of authenticated firmware updates, and system firmware updates to mitigate specific attack steps.\n\nThe category DataResources defines assets like Signal, ControlSignal, IcsData, and IcsControlData, which represent data and control information sent over the ICS network. Each of these assets has basic attack steps like access, read, write, delete, manipulate, and block signals.\n\nThe associations section defines relationships between assets, such as the relationship between IcsHardware and critical subsystems, redundant subsystems, safeguarded systems (SIS), signalSourceApp, signalDestApp, controlSignalSourceApp, controlSignalDestApp, sensor, data, sysSensor, actuator, dataActuator, sysActuator, synchronizedApp, encryptedSignal, containerSignal, and encryptCreds.\n\nIn summary, the MAL code defines a domain-specific threat modeling language for ICS systems, which allows analysts to model various attack scenarios, mitigation strategies, and relationships between assets in an ICS environment.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ICSlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"org.mal-lang.coreLang/coreLang.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/Controller.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/ControlServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/DataHistorian.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/EngineeringWorkstation.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/HMI.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/IOServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/SIS.mal\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines a category named `ComputeResources` that models different types of assets in an industrial control system (ICS) environment. These assets include ICS hardware, ICS applications, sensors, actuators, and synchronization modules.\n\n1. **ICS Hardware (IcsHardware)**: This asset extends the core `Hardware` class and represents hardware components in an ICS environment. It has several attack vectors such as physical access, full access, and specific access. The full access vector provides the attacker with control over the system, leading to potential loss of safety, loss of control, loss of view, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control. The system can also be shut down intentionally or unintentionally due to these attacks. There are several defense mechanisms proposed to mitigate these attacks, such as module firmware verification, using cryptography keys for firmware updates, and using authenticated firmware updates.\n\n2. **ICS Applications (IcsApplication)**: This asset extends the core `Application` class and represents software components in an ICS environment. It has specific access, full access, and normal operation vectors. The full access vector allows the attacker to manipulate the system, leading to restricted operation, manipulation of control, manipulation of view, loss of control, loss of view, and theft of operational information.\n\n3. **Sensor**: This asset generates data via a signal but may not have any associated software or host. An attacker with physical access can manipulate or block the signal, leading to manipulation of the data, loss of view, or manipulation of the system.\n\n4. **Actuator**: This asset consumes data from a signal but may not have any associated software or host. Manipulating or blocking the signal can lead to manipulation of the associated system or loss of control, respectively.\n\n5. **Synchronization Module**: This asset provides synchronization capabilities, such as a GPS receiver or a network-based synchronization module. It can be compromised, leading to manipulation of clock frequency, manipulation of time, or stopping the clock. These actions can further impact synchronized applications by causing manipulation of control, manipulation of view, loss of control, or loss of view.\n\nThe MAL code also includes various attack steps for each asset, explaining the logical flow and relationships between elements. These attack steps are propagated to parent systems, allowing for modeling of complex ICS environments with multiple layers of redundancy. The code also highlights domain-specific implications, such as MITRE ATT&CK ICS techniques, and provides suggestions for potential defenses.", "output": "category ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines several assets, attack steps, and associations related to data and control signals in a cybersecurity threat modeling context, specifically for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Here's an exhaustive but concise description of the structure and semantics of the MAL code:\n\n**Category DataResources**\n\nThis category contains several assets and attack steps related to data and signals in the context of ICS.\n\n**Assets:**\n\n1. **Signal:** Represents information that is transmitted between two assets, regardless of the medium. If data or information are transmitted over a known medium, use the IcsData or DataInTransit associations instead.\n\n2. **ControlSignal (extends Signal):** Represents control commands that are transmitted between two assets, regardless of the medium. If control commands are transmitted over a known medium, use the IcsControlData asset and the DataInTransit association instead.\n\n3. **IcsData:** Extends the coreLang's Data asset with One-Time (OT) attack vectors and directionality for non-control information. This data represents the non-control information sent over the OT network.\n\n4. **IcsControlData:** Extends the coreLang's Data asset with OT attack vectors and directionality for control information. This data represents the control information sent over the OT network.\n\n**Attack Steps:**\n\n- **attemptAccess:** Attempt to access the data. May fail if the 'dataNotPresent' defense is used.\n- **access:** Access the data, leading to attemptRead, attemptWrite, and attemptDelete.\n- **attemptRead, attemptWrite, attemptDelete:** Attempt to read, write, or delete the data, respectively.\n- **readContainedInformationAndData:** From the data, attempt to access also the contained information/data, if exists.\n- **manipulateSignal:** When an attacker sends a false or manipulated signal.\n- **blockSignal:** When an attacker blocks a signal from being sent/received.\n- **dataEncrypted:** If the data are encrypted, then accessing them requires the associated encryption credentials/key.\n- **authenticated:** If the data are authenticated, then modifying them is not possible.\n- **dataNotPresent:** Models the probability of data actually not existing on the connected container.\n- **encryptCreds:** Used to model the acquisition of encryption credentials necessary to access encrypted data.\n- **accessUnencryptedData:** Access the unencrypted data.\n- **accessDecryptedData:** Intermediate attack step to allow effects of 'accessUnencryptedData' on data after compromising the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled.\n- **read:** The attacker can read the data.\n- **write:** The attacker can write to the location of the data, effectively deleting it.\n- **delete:** The attacker can delete the data.\n- **manipulateSignal (for ControlSignal):** When an attacker sends a false or manipulated control signal.\n- **blockSignal (for ControlSignal):** When an attacker blocks a control signal from being sent/received.\n- **manipulationOfView:** The manipulation of view on the destination(s) when the data is manipulated or deleted.\n- **lossOfView:** The loss of view on the destination(s) when the data is not accessible (e.g., denied access or not present).\n- **manipulationOfControl:** The manipulation of control on the source(s) when the data is manipulated or deleted.\n- **lossOfControl:** The loss of control on the source(s) when the data is not accessible (e.g., denied access or not present).\n\n**Associations:**\n\n- **DataInTransit:** Not directly defined in the provided code, but it is mentioned as an alternative to use when data or information are transmitted over a known medium.\n\n**Logical Flow and Relationships:**\n\nThe attack steps are organized in a logical flow that reflects the process of accessing, reading, writing, and deleting data or control signals. The dataEncrypted and authenticated attack steps introduce conditions that may prevent access or modification of the data. The dataNotPresent attack step models the probability of data not existing on the connected container.

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines an `IcsHardware` asset that extends the `Hardware` asset in the core language. This asset model is specific to Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and includes additional attack vectors.\n\nThe `IcsHardware` asset has two main components: `moduleFirmware` and `systemFirmware`. Adversaries can potentially install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices (`moduleFirmware`) or exploit the firmware update feature on accessible devices to upload malicious or out-of-date firmware (`systemFirmware`).\n\nThe MAL code provides several defenses to mitigate these attack vectors:\n\n1. `moduleFirmwareVerification`: Verify the module's firmware from the main firmware upon boot-up or during normal operation.\n2. `useCryptographyKeyForFirmware`: Use a cryptographic key for firmware updates to make it harder to alter the firmware.\n3. `useAuthenticatedFirmwareUpdates`: Perform authentication of the source and data for firmware updates to prevent malicious alteration.\n\nThe `IcsHardware` asset can also be connected to a Safety Instrumented System (SIS), and if not connected, the safety mechanisms should be disabled (`sisConnected @hidden`).\n\nThe MAL code includes various attack steps, such as `lossOfSafety`, `shutdown`, `damageToProperty`, `lossOfControl`, `lossOfView`, `lossOfAvailability`, `lossOfProductivityAndRevenue`, `manipulationOfControl`, and `manipulationOfView`. These attack steps represent different ways an adversary can disrupt or manipulate the ICS system.\n\nIn addition, the code includes propagate attack steps for critical and redundant subsystems, which model the cascading effects of an attack on multiple subsystems. For instance, if any of the critical subsystems experience a shutdown, the parent system will also be shut down (`propagateCriticalShutdown`).\n\nFinally, the MAL code includes a `notDisabled` defense, which models the possibility of removing some IcsHardware used to provide redundancy. If a particular IcsHardware is not present, various attack steps can occur, such as `lossOfControl`, `lossOfView`, `lossOfAvailability`, `lossOfProductivityAndRevenue`, `manipulationOfControl`, `manipulationOfView`, and `shutdown`.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a structured and detailed model for threat modeling ICS systems, incorporating various attack vectors, defenses, and relationships between components.

{"input": "Title: Meta Attack Language (MAL) Description for Asset \"Sensor\"\n\nThe asset \"Sensor\" in MAL represents an object that generates data via a signal, but it may not be associated with software or a host. The primary function of a sensor is to collect data, which can be used for various purposes such as monitoring, surveillance, or analysis.\n\nIn the context of cybersecurity, sensors can be vulnerable to attacks if an attacker gains physical access to them. This is because the attacker can manipulate the sensor's signal or block the signal entirely, potentially denying the system access to the data it needs. Additionally, an attacker may attempt to write false data into the sensor or deny the system access to the data altogether. In extreme cases, an attacker might manipulate the sensor's view or cause a loss of view, which could lead to incorrect data being collected or the system losing vital information.\n\nThe MAL code for the Sensor asset includes a component called \"physicalAccess\". This component represents the situation where an attacker has gained physical access to the location where the sensor is physically deployed. From this point, the attacker can perform several actions, including:\n\n1. manipulateSignal: The attacker manipulates the sensor's signal, potentially causing the system to collect incorrect data.\n2. blockSignal: The attacker blocks the sensor's signal, preventing the system from collecting data.\n3. attemptWrite: The attacker attempts to write false data into the sensor.\n4. attemptDeny: The attacker attempts to deny the system access to the data collected by the sensor.\n5. lossOfView: The attacker causes a loss of view for the sensor, preventing it from collecting data.\n6. manipulationOfView: The attacker manipulates the sensor's view, potentially causing the system to collect incorrect data.\n\nThese components and associations illustrate the logical flow and relationships between the physical access of a sensor and the potential attacks an attacker can perform on it. Understanding these relationships is crucial for cybersecurity professionals to determine potential vulnerabilities and implement appropriate defenses to protect their systems.\n\nIn terms of domain-specific implications, the MAL code for the Sensor asset highlights the importance of physical security measures for sensors in cybersecurity systems. It also emphasizes the need for robust data validation and system monitoring mechanisms to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data being collected by these sensors.\n\nOverall, the Sensor asset in MAL provides a valuable framework for cybersecurity professionals to model potential threats and vulnerabilities related to sensors in their systems, ultimately aiding in the development of effective defense strategies.", "output": "asset Sensor\n      user info: \"An object that generates data (via a signal) but may not have any associated software or host.\"\n      modeler info: \"It would be vulnerable to an attacker that can gain physical access to it.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access on the location where the sensor is physically deployed.\"\n        ->  signal.manipulateSignal,\n            signal.blockSignal,\n            data.attemptWrite,\n            data.attemptDeny,\n            system.lossOfView,\n            system.manipulationOfView\n    }", "type": "asset"}

If manipulated, the actuator is also considered manipulated, leading to a manipulation of control on the associated system.\n\n2. `block`: This component describes the behavior of the actuator when the signal it consumes is blocked. If the signal is blocked, the actuator is also considered blocked, which leads to a loss of control and loss of availability on the associated system.\n\nIn summary, the `Actuator` asset in MAL represents a device or object that can be controlled through signals.

The asset is subject to potential attacks that can manipulate its clock frequency, manipulate time, or stop the clock entirely.\n\nThe MAL code defines three attack steps associated with the `SynchronizationModule` asset:\n\n1. `compromise`: This attack step does not have specific child steps defined, but it indirectly triggers the manipulation of the clock frequency, manipulation of time, or stopping of the clock.\n\n2. `manipulateClockFrequency`: This attack step, when executed, leads to the manipulation of the control and the view of the synchronized application. The control manipulation may affect the internal mechanisms of the synchronization module, while the manipulation of the view could impact the user interface or external communications.\n\n3. `manipulateTime`: Similar to `manipulateClockFrequency`, this attack step also leads to the manipulation of the control and the view of the synchronized application, potentially causing disruptions in the synchronization module's functioning and external communications.\n\n4. `stopClock`: When this attack step is executed, it causes the loss of control and loss of view for the synchronized application. The loss of control may prevent the synchronization module from functioning correctly, while the loss of view could make it unable to communicate or present accurate information to the user.\n\nIn summary, the `SynchronizationModule` asset in the MAL code is designed to model any synchronization component that might be targeted by an attacker to manipulate its clock frequency, time, or even stop the clock entirely.

From there, the attacker can attempt to read, write, or delete the data. If the data is encrypted, the attacker needs to acquire the associated encryption credentials/key to access the data (`encryptCreds`). If the data is authenticated, modification is not possible. If data is unencrypted, the attacker can access it directly (`accessUnencryptedData`).\n\nThe `accessUnencryptedData` step has an alternative path (`accessDecryptedData @hidden`) that is only reached if the encryption credentials are compromised or encryption is disabled. From this step, the attacker can read contained information and data, read the data itself, write to the data location (effectively deleting it), or manipulate or block the signal.\n\nThe `dataNotPresent` defense is in series with `accessUnencryptedData` because there is no reason to defend non-existent data.\n\n**Domain-Specific Implications:**\n\nThis MAL code is inspired by the attack steps of the data asset in the coreLang and focuses on information transmitted as signals.

It consists of two associations:\n   - `dataActuator.block`: This action blocks the data, denying access to it.\n   - `receiverApp[IcsApplication].lossOfControl`: This association represents the loss of control on the source(s) due to the successful deny operation.\n\nLogical Flow and Relationships:\n\nThe `IcsControlData` class defines three components: `successfulWrite`, `successfulDelete`, and `successfulDeny`. Each component represents a different action that can be taken on the control data. The actions are associated with specific consequences on both the source and destination of the control data.\n\nThe `dataActuator.manipulate`, `dataActuator.block`, and `dataActuator.block` associations represent actions taken on the data by an actor or attacker. The `receiverApp[IcsApplication].manipulationOfControl` and `receiverApp[IcsApplication].lossOfControl` associations represent the consequences of these actions on the control system.\n\nDomain-Specific Implications:\n\nThe `IcsControlData` extension is specific to ICS and OT networks. It introduces attack vectors and consequences that are relevant to the control of industrial systems. Understanding this extension is crucial for threat modeling and securing ICS networks.\n\nNote: This description provides a high-level overview of the `IcsControlData` extension in MAL.

{"input": "This MAL code defines various associations between different entities in an Industrial Control System (ICS) threat model, including IcsHardware, IcsApplication, Sensor, Actuator, SynchronizationModule, Signal, and Credentials.\n\n1. **IcsHardware**: Represents hardware components in an ICS. Each IcsHardware can have one criticalParentSystem or redundantParentSystem, indicating that a disruption in the critical subsystem or redundant subsystem will affect the parent system accordingly. Additionally, an IcsHardware can have one SIS (Safety Instrumented System) assigned to it to ensure safe operation.\n\n2. **IcsApplication**: Represents software applications in an ICS. Each IcsApplication can transmit, receive, and control signals. Multiple IcsApplications can be synchronized using a SynchronizationModule.\n\n3. **Sensor**: Represents sensors that measure specific parameters in an ICS. Each Sensor can be associated with a signal, data, and an IcsHardware system.\n\n4. **Actuator**: Represents actuators that control devices or systems in an ICS. Each Actuator can be associated with a signal, data, and an IcsHardware system.\n\n5. **SynchronizationModule**: Represents a module used to provide synchronization on the signals sent by IcsApplications.\n\n6. **Signal**: Represents a signal transmitted between different entities in an ICS. Each Signal can be encrypted, contain data or information, and be associated with a SynchronizationModule and Credentials for encryption.\n\n7. **Credentials**: Represents the encryption credentials used for encrypting signals.\n\nThe associations define the relationships between these entities, such as the flow of signals, data, and control commands, and the impact of disruptions in subsystems on the parent system.
