{"input": "Title: Safety Instrumented System (SIS) in MAL (org.mal_lang.SISlang)\n\nDescription:\nThe provided MAL code defines a category for a Safety Instrumented System (SIS), a critical component in industrial control systems that ensures plant safety during abnormal conditions. The SIS is an extension of the IcsHardware asset.\n\nAsset (SIS):\n- Purpose: Automated safety actions to maintain or transition a plant to a safe state during abnormal conditions.\n- Function: The SIS takes two primary actions: shutdown and remaining enabled (notDisabled).\n  - Shutdown: Triggers when the safeguarded system experiences a loss of safety.\n  - notDisabled (Enabled): Represents the probability that the SIS is not actually present, used for cases like removing the SIS safeguarding an IcsHardware or removing redundant SIS subsystems.\n\nAttack Steps:\n- There are no explicit attack steps defined in this MAL code. However, the presence of an asset like SIS may be targeted in cyber-attacks aiming to compromise plant safety.\n\nDefenses:\n- The notDisabled state provides a mechanism to model the removal of SIS safeguarding an IcsHardware or redundant SIS subsystems, which could be used for defense-in-depth strategies.\n\nAssociations:\n- There are no associations defined in this MAL code.\n\nLogical Flow:\n1. The SIS is in its default state, ready to take automated action when needed.\n2. If the safeguarded system experiences a loss of safety, the SIS triggers a shutdown.\n3. If the notDisabled state is modeled, the SIS is represented as being offline, and the trigger for redundant shutdown is propagated.\n\nDomain-Specific Implications:\n- The SIS is a crucial component in industrial control systems, particularly in industries like energy, manufacturing, and transportation, where plant safety is paramount. Any compromise of the SIS could lead to catastrophic consequences.\n- Understanding the presence and configuration of SIS in a system is essential for threat modeling and risk assessment.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a means to model Safety Instrumented Systems in threat modeling, allowing analysts to account for their presence, potential compromise, and removal in their security assessments.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.SISlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\ncategory IcsControlResources{\n\n    asset SIS extends IcsHardware\n        user info: \"A safety instrumented system (SIS) takes automated action to keep a plant in a safe state, or to put it into a safe state, when abnormal conditions are present.\"\n      {\n        | shutdown @Override\n            +> safeguardedSystem.lossOfSafety\n\n        # notDisabled @Override [Enabled]\n          developer info: \"The probability that a particular SIS is not actually present.\"\n          modeler info: \"The use cases for this are removing the SIS safeguarding an IcsHardware and removing redundant SIS subsystems.\"\n          -> safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline,\n             triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown\n\n      }\n\n}\n\nassociations {\n\n}", "type": "language"}
{"input": "Title: Description of IcsControlResources Category with SIS Asset in Meta Attack Language (MAL)\n\nThe IcsControlResources category in Meta Attack Language (MAL) is used to define and model safety instrumented systems (SIS) in Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. An SIS is a hardware component that takes automated action to maintain or transition a plant to a safe state when abnormal conditions are detected.\n\nIn this specific MAL code, an SIS asset is defined, which includes the following components:\n\n1. **Asset name**: SIS (derived from the IcsHardware superclass)\n   - **Purpose**: To safeguard the associated IcsHardware from potential hazards by transitioning it to a safe state.\n\n2. **Defense Mechanism**: notDisabled\n   - **Purpose**: To model the possibility that a specific SIS may not be functioning as intended.\n   - **Properties**:\n     - Enabled: Indicates that the SIS is currently active and able to perform its intended function.\n   - **Associations**:\n     - safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline: Represents the state of safety mechanisms associated with the SIS when it is not disabled.\n     - triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown: Triggers the propagation of a redundant shutdown when the SIS becomes offline or disabled.\n\n3. **Attack Step**: shutdown\n   - **Purpose**: To simulate an intentional shutdown of the SIS-protected IcsHardware due to unsafe conditions.\n   - **Association**: safeguardedSystem.lossOfSafety: Represents the loss of safety in the protected IcsHardware due to the shutdown.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code is as follows:\n\n1. Initially, the SIS is enabled and safeguarding the associated IcsHardware.\n2. If the shutdown attack step is triggered, the SIS transitions the protected IcsHardware to a safe state (shutdown), leading to the loss of safety in the safeguarded system.\n3. If the SIS is intentionally disabled (notDisabled defense mechanism), the SIS is removed from service, causing its associated IcsHardware to be exposed to potential hazards. This may trigger the propagation of a redundant shutdown if other SIS subsystems are present.\n\nIn the context of ICS cybersecurity, this MAL code highlights the importance of ensuring the proper functioning of safety instrumented systems to maintain plant safety and prevent potential hazards. It also provides a means to model and analyze potential threats to these critical systems.", "output": "category IcsControlResources{\n\n    asset SIS extends IcsHardware\n        user info: \"A safety instrumented system (SIS) takes automated action to keep a plant in a safe state, or to put it into a safe state, when abnormal conditions are present.\"\n      {\n        | shutdown @Override\n            +> safeguardedSystem.lossOfSafety\n\n        # notDisabled @Override [Enabled]\n          developer info: \"The probability that a particular SIS is not actually present.\"\n          modeler info: \"The use cases for this are removing the SIS safeguarding an IcsHardware and removing redundant SIS subsystems.\"\n          -> safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline,\n             triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown\n\n      }\n\n}", "type": "category"}
{"input": "Title: MAL Code Description for Safety Instrumented System (SIS) Asset\n\nThe provided MAL code defines a Safety Instrumented System (SIS), which is an automated safety system designed to maintain a plant in a safe state or to safely shut it down when abnormal conditions arise.\n\n**Components:**\n\n1. `shutdown` - This is an attack step that aims to cause the SIS to shut down the associated safeguarded system due to loss of safety.\n\n2. `notDisabled` - This is a property that represents the probability that the SIS is not actually present or functioning. It is marked as Enabled by default.\n\n**Associations:**\n\n1. `shutdown` is associated with the `safeguardedSystem` asset through the `lossOfSafety` event. When the `shutdown` attack step occurs, it affects the state of the `safeguardedSystem`.\n\n2. The `notDisabled` property is associated with the following elements:\n   - `safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline`: This represents the state of the safety mechanisms related to the safeguarded system, indicating that they are offline due to the SIS being non-functional.\n   - `triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown`: This event is triggered when redundant SIS subsystems are removed, which may lead to the propagation of shutdown events if the removed SIS was responsible for safeguarding the system.\n\n**Logical Flow and Relationships:**\n\n1. The `shutdown` attack step is executed when the `lossOfSafety` event occurs for the `safeguardedSystem`.\n\n2. The `notDisabled` property is a condition that, when true, indicates that the SIS is not present or functioning, leading to the `safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline` state and potential propagation of the `triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown` event.\n\n**Domain-Specific Implications:**\n\nThis MAL code represents a critical component in ICS threat modeling, as it models the behavior and potential vulnerabilities of a safety instrumented system, which plays a crucial role in ensuring the safe operation of industrial control systems. The `notDisabled` property can be used to model scenarios where the SIS is intentionally or unintentionally disabled, leading to increased risk for the system and the surrounding environment.", "output": "asset SIS extends IcsHardware\n        user info: \"A safety instrumented system (SIS) takes automated action to keep a plant in a safe state, or to put it into a safe state, when abnormal conditions are present.\"\n      {\n        | shutdown @Override\n            +> safeguardedSystem.lossOfSafety\n\n        # notDisabled @Override [Enabled]\n          developer info: \"The probability that a particular SIS is not actually present.\"\n          modeler info: \"The use cases for this are removing the SIS safeguarding an IcsHardware and removing redundant SIS subsystems.\"\n          -> safeguardedSystem.safetyMechanismsOffline,\n             triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown\n\n      }", "type": "asset"}
{"input": "Title: Association in Meta Attack Language (MAL) - Relationship Definition\n\nDescription:\n\nIn the Meta Attack Language (MAL), the `associations` block is used to define relationships between different elements within a threat model. This block does not contain any specific attack steps, assets, defenses, or actions, but rather establishes connections between these elements.\n\nThe `associations` block in MAL consists of a list of association declarations, each of which defines a relationship between two elements using a specific association type. Each association declaration has the following structure:\n\n```\nassociation_type association_id source_element target_element [association_properties]\n```\n\n1. `association_type`: This is the name of the relationship type, such as `attack_path`, `data_flow`, or `vulnerability_exploitation`. The association type defines the nature of the relationship between the source and target elements.\n\n2. `association_id`: A unique identifier for the association, used to refer to it elsewhere in the MAL model.\n\n3. `source_element`: This is the element that initiates the association, which can be an asset, attack step, or defense.\n\n4. `target_element`: This is the element that the association points to, which can also be an asset, attack step, or defense.\n\n5. `association_properties` (optional): This is a set of key-value pairs that provide additional information about the association, such as the data direction (`in`, `out`, or `bidirectional`), the attacker's motivation, or the common vulnerability and exposure (CVE) identifier for a known vulnerability being exploited.\n\nThe `associations` block helps to visualize and understand the relationships between different components in a cybersecurity threat model, facilitating the analysis and mitigation of potential threats. Understanding these relationships is crucial for a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, as it allows analysts to identify attack paths, data flows, and vulnerability exploitations that could lead to security breaches.", "output": "associations {\n\n}", "type": "association"}
