{"input": "Title: Vehicle Language Encryption Framework in Meta Attack Language (MAL)\n\nDescription:\n\nThe provided MAL code defines a communication category called \"VehicleLangEncryption\" with the version number \"1.0.0\". This category is designed to model a system that encrypts and decrypts data, with a focus on ensuring the security of the encryption and decryption keys.\n\nIn this model, there are two primary assets:\n\n1. CoreEncryptedData: This is an extended version of the Data asset. It has two authorized actions - read and write, which lead to the readEncrypted and writeEncrypted steps, respectively.\n\n   - readEncrypted and writeEncrypted steps simply perform read and write operations on the encrypted data.\n\n   - The defense steps, decryptionKeysExist and encryptionKeysExist, are designed to check if the necessary decryption and encryption keys exist, respectively. If any keys exist, these defense steps are compromised, meaning the attacker has access to the decryption or encryption keys. If no keys exist, these defense steps prevent the readEncrypted or writeEncrypted steps from being reached, ensuring the data remains secure.\n\n2. CryptographicKey: This is another extended version of the Data asset, representing a cryptographic key. It has a read action that can be used to access either the decrypted data or write encrypted data.\n\nThe associations between these assets are clearly defined. The CoreEncryptedData asset has a decryptedData association with the CryptographicKey, which can be decrypted using the keys associated with the CryptographicKey. Similarly, there is an encryptedData association, which can be encrypted using the keys associated with the CryptographicKey.\n\nThis MAL code model represents a simple encryption and decryption system, emphasizing the importance of securing the cryptographic keys to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data. The domain-specific implications are clear: the system should be designed with strong key management practices to ensure the security of the encrypted data.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.VehiclelangEncrying\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\ncategory Communication {\n\n\tasset CoreEncryptedData extends Data\n \t\tuser info: \"Data is a concrete, syntactic representation of Information at rest.\"\n\t\tdeveloper info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n   {\n\n\t   & authorizedRead\n\t      user info: \"Access and authentication will allow reading of data.\"\n\t      -> readEncrypted\n\n\t   & authorizedWrite\n\t      user info: \"Access and authentication will allow writing of data.\"\n\t      -> writeEncrypted\n\n\t\t& readEncrypted\n\t\t\t->\tread\n\n\t\t& writeEncrypted\n\t\t\t-> write\n\n        E decryptionKeysExist\n      \t\tuser info: \"If any decryption keys exist, this defense step is compromised, but if not, this will prevent readEncrypted from being reached.\"\n      \t\tdeveloper info: \"Without this step, readEncrypted will, in the case of no modelled keys, be compromised, which is counterintuitive.\"\n         \t<- decryptionKeys\n         \t-> readEncrypted\n\n\t   E encryptionKeysExist\n\t      user info: \"If any encryption keys exist, this defense step is compromised, but if not, this will prevent witeEncrypted from being reached.\"\n\t      developer info: \"Without this step, writeEncrypted will, in the case of no modelled keys, be compromised, which is counterintuitive.\"\n          <- encryptionKeys\n\t\t  -> writeEncrypted\n\t\t}\n}\n\ncategory Security{\n\n\tasset CryptographicKey extends Data \n\t\tdeveloper info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n\t{\n\t\t| read\n\t\t -> decryptedData.readEncrypted,\n\t\t\tencryptedData.writeEncrypted\n\n\t}\n\n}\n\nassociations {\n\tCoreEncryptedData\t[decryptedData]\t\t\t\t*\t<-- Decryption\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t*\t[decryptionKeys]\t\t\t\tCryptographicKey\n   \tCoreEncryptedData\t[encryptedData]\t\t\t\t*\t<-- Encryption\t\t\t\t\t\t-->\t*\t[encryptionKeys]\t\t\t\tCryptographicKey\n}", "type": "language"}
