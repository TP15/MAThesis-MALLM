{"input": "This MAL code defines a domain-specific threat modeling language for cybersecurity focused on vehicle systems. The language includes several categories, each representing a different aspect of the system: System, Networking, Communication, Security, and Associations.\n\nThe System category defines various asset types, including PhysicalMachine, SensorOrActuator, Machine, ECU, GatewayECU, VehicularApplication, Firmware, OperatingSystem, Service, Client, NetworkClient, VehicleNetworkReceiver, NetworkService, UDSService, TransmitterService, and FirmwareUpdaterService. Each asset represents a different component of the vehicle system, such as physical machines, sensors, actuators, ECUs, gateways, applications, services, and network clients.\n\nThe System category also defines attack steps that can be performed on these assets, such as connect, authenticate, bypassAccessControl, manipulate, deny, idControl, and machineAccess. These attack steps describe actions that an attacker can take to gain unauthorized access to assets, manipulate their behavior, or deny their services.\n\nThe Networking category defines VehicleNetwork, which represents vehicle networks like CAN bus, FlexRay, and LIN bus. It also defines several network-specific attacks, such as accessUninspected, accessNetworkLayer, eavesdrop, adversaryInTheMiddle, messageInjection, deny, _networkForwarding, _bypassIDPS, and _noIDPS.\n\nThe Communication category defines Dataflow, which represents channels that contain data in transit. It also defines ConnectionOrientedDataflow and ConnectionlessDataflow, which represent unicast/multicast and multicast/broadcast transmissions, respectively. This category also defines several data flow-related attack steps, such as eavesdrop, deny, adversaryInTheMiddle, request, respond, maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS, maliciousTransmit, eavesdropId, and eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection.\n\nThe Security category defines VehicularIdentity, VehicularCredentials, and MessageID, which represent identities, credentials, and message IDs, respectively.\n\nThe Associations category defines relationships between different components in the system, such as the relationship between machines and the applications that execute on them, the relationship between networks and data flows, the relationship between data flows and the data they transmit, and the relationship between IDPS and gateway ECUs.\n\nThe MAL code also includes several domain-specific implications, such as the fact that some assets extended from the coreLang, the fact that some attacks can be reached only from specific entry points or from GatewayEcu.fullAccess, and the fact that some attacks on specific networks may not be successful if only limited parts of the network's protocol are used.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a structured and comprehensive language for modeling threats to vehicle systems, allowing analysts to effectively identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.", "output": "// vehicleLang\n// Author: Sotirios Katsikeas (sotkat@kth.se)\n// Last major revision: July 2019\n\n//include \"vehicleLangEncryption.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLangEthernet.mal\"\ninclude \"vehicleLangPublicInterfaces.mal\"\n// All includes should be placed above this line, and not on included files for better tracebility.\n\ncategory System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

{"input": "This Meta Attack Language (MAL) code defines a set of assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations for modeling cybersecurity threats in the context of a vehicle's electronic control units (ECUs) and their interconnected networks.\n\nThe `System` category contains the following assets:\n\n1. `PhysicalMachine`: A base asset representing any physical machine. It has two attack steps, `connect` and `fullAccess`, with the latter leading to the `manipulate` attack step.\n\n2. `SensorOrActuator`: An asset representing physical machines like sensors and actuators. It extends `PhysicalMachine` and includes the same attack steps, with the addition of the `manipulate` step defining what an attacker can do once they have full access.\n\n3. `Machine`: An asset representing machines with higher complexity than simple actuators or sensors. It extends `Hardware` (not defined in the provided code) and includes the `connect`, `authenticate`, `bypassAccessControl`, `fullAccess`, `idControl`, `deny`, `_accessData`, `passFirmwareValidation`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`, and `gainNetworkAccess` attack steps.\n\n4. `ECU`: An asset representing any ECU/MCU/controller in a vehicle. It extends `Machine` and includes the `connect`, `maliciousFirmwareUpload`, `uploadFirmware`, `_ecuNetworkAccess`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`, `passFirmwareValidation`, `fullAccess`, `idControl`, `offline`, `shutdown`, `changeOperationMode`, `attemptChangeOperationMode`, `operationModeProtection`, `bypassMessageConfliction`, `_networkServiceMessageInjection`, `messageConflictionProtection`, `gainLINAccessFromCAN`, `GatewayECU`, and associated attack steps.\n\n5. `GatewayECU`: An asset representing a gateway/firewall ECU. It extends `ECU` and includes the `fullAccess`, `forwarding`, `bypassFirewall`, `gatewayBypassIDPS`, `gatewayNoIDPS`, `idpsExists`, `idpsDoesNotExist`, `deny`, and associated attack steps.\n\n6. `VehicularApplication`, `Firmware`, `OperatingSystem`, `Service`, `Client`, `NetworkClient`, `VehicleNetworkReceiver`, `NetworkService`, `UDSService`, `TransmitterService`, and `FirmwareUpdaterService`: These are abstract assets representing various types of applications, services, and network components in a vehicle. They are extended or defined further in the code, but are left empty or intentionally blank.\n\nThe MAL code defines various attack steps, such as `connect`, `authenticate`, `bypassAccessControl`, `manipulate`, `deny`, `attemptRead`, `attemptWrite`, `attemptDelete`, `maliciousFirmwareModification`, `crackFirmwareValidation`, `bypassSecureBoot`, and `serviceMessageInjection`. These steps outline different ways an attacker can interact with the defined assets, such as gaining access, manipulating data, or performing denial of service attacks.\n\nDefenses are modeled as well, such as `firewallProtection`, `messageConflictionProtection`, `secureBoot`, and `udsSecurityAccess`. These defenses represent protective mechanisms like firewalls, message confliction protection, secure boot, and authentication protocols that the system can employ to prevent or mitigate attacks.\n\nAssociations between assets and attack steps are established using the `->` operator, which implies a straightforward relationship. The `+>` operator, on the other hand, signifies that an attack step requires the successful completion of the prerequisite steps. For example, the `fullAccess` attack step for a `Machine` requires either a successful authentication or a bypass of access control.\n\nThe MAL code also includes probabilistic attack steps marked with the `Exponential(X)` annotation, where `X` is a probability value between 0 and 1. These steps represent attacks that have a certain success rate.\n\nIn summary, this MAL code defines a structured language for modeling threat scenarios in the context of automotive systems, allowing analysts to understand, analyze, and mitigate potential cybersecurity threats to vehicle networks and ECUs.", "output": "category System {\n    \n    abstract asset PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies any physical machine.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"This is empty in order to be overriden.\"\n    }\n\n    asset SensorOrActuator extends PhysicalMachine\n        user info: \"Specifies physical machines like sensors and actuators.\"\n    {\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Connect leads directly to access on a physical machine since no authentication is done/needed.\"\n                ->  fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                user info: \"Access means that the attacker has full access on the machine, ex. he can manipulate the actuator's behavior or sensor's measurements.\"\n                ->  manipulate\n\n        | manipulate\n                developer info: \"This is empty for now because it is enough to reach this.\"\n    }\n\n    asset Machine extends Hardware\n        user info: \"Specifies any machine that has higher complexity than a simple actuator or sensor.\"\n        developer info: \"Extended from coreLang.\"\n    {\n\n        | connect\n                user info: \"Attempt to connect to a machine.\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess,\n                    connectPrivileges.assume,\n                    connectionVulnerabilities.exploit\n\n        | authenticate\n                user info: \"Does the attacker have the credentials of an identity?\"\n                ->\tauthenticatedAccess\n\n        & authenticatedAccess\n                  user info: \"One way to gain access to a machine is through legitimate authentication.\"\n                ->\tfullAccess\n\n        | bypassAccessControl [Exponential(0.02)]\n                user info: \"An attacker can bypass access control and authenticate to the machine.\"\n                -> fullAccess\n\n        | fullAccess\n                developer info: \"We don't explicitly model root access; that is not a sound primitive.

The language differentiates between two types of data flows: Connection Oriented Dataflow and Connectionless Dataflow.\n\n1. Dataflow: This is a general channel that contains data in transit. It has several attack steps:\n   - eavesdrop: An attacker can access the data, and if it's encrypted, confidentiality might not be breached.\n   - deny: A denial-of-service attack makes the data inaccessible, but the information may still be available elsewhere.\n   - adversaryInTheMiddle: An attacker controls the data, but if it's encrypted and authenticated, confidentiality and integrity are maintained.\n   - request and respond: These steps represent normal communication flows.\n   - maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, and maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS: These represent malicious activities, with the latter two bypassing IDPS and confliction protection mechanisms.\n   - eavesdropId: The attacker eavesdrops and reads the unique ID of the message.\n   - eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection: The attacker eavesdrops, reads the unique ID, and bypasses the confliction protection mechanism.\n\n2. Connection Oriented Dataflow: This is a unicast or multicast transmission that contains data in transit. It includes all the attack steps from the Dataflow asset, plus additional ones:\n   - request: Initiates a network connection without inspection.\n   - respond: Responds to a network connection without inspection.\n   - maliciousRespond: A malicious response that may take time to bypass the confliction protection mechanism.\n\n3.

It includes all the attack steps from the Dataflow asset, plus additional ones:\n   - eavesdrop: An attacker can access the data, and if it's encrypted, confidentiality might not be breached.\n   - adversaryInTheMiddle: An attacker controls the data, but if it's encrypted and authenticated, confidentiality and integrity are maintained.\n   - maliciousTransmitNoIDPS, maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection, and maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS: These represent malicious activities, with the latter two bypassing IDPS and confliction protection mechanisms.\n   - maliciousTransmit: The act of trying to maliciously transmit.

Compromising a VehicularIdentity can lead to authentication on machines, access rights on data, and authentication on other connected identities. The asset has the following components:\n   - `assumed`: This component allows the attacker to authenticate on machines, connect to machines, read, write, or delete private data, and attempt to assume child identities.\n\n2. **VehicularCredentials**: This asset is an extension of the Credentials asset from the coreLang. It allows an attacker to read the stored firmware validation/access key. Once the key is read, it can be used to pass firmware validation and modification on the connected machines that the compromised VehicularIdentity has access to. The asset has the following components:\n   - `read`: This component allows the attacker to attempt to assume the VehicularIdentity and read the firmware access key.\n   - `readFirmwareAccessKey`: This action represents the reading of a stored firmware validation/access key. If successful, it allows the attacker to pass firmware validation and modification on the connected machines of the compromised VehicularIdentity.\n\n3. **MessageID**: This asset represents the ID that resides on the header of a transmitted packet/message/dataflow.

It leads to deny, access data, machineExecutedApps' local connect, and access vulnerabilities exploit.\n\n8. `deny`: This attack step performs a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the machine, denying access to machineExecutedApps and hostedData.\n\n9. `_accessData`: This is a helper attack step to request access on data stored on the machine, leading to attempted read, write, and delete on hostedData.\n\n10. `passFirmwareValidation`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`: These are blank helper attack steps that will be used from the childs of the asset.\n\n11. `gainNetworkAccess`: This attack step is specific to the infotainment system asset.\n\nThe logical flow starts with the `connect` step, which requires authenticated access, connect privileges, and can exploit connection vulnerabilities. If the attacker has the credentials (`authenticate`), they gain authenticated access, which eventually leads to full access (`authenticatedAccess` or `bypassAccessControl`). With full access, the attacker can perform various actions such as denying service (`deny`), accessing data (`_accessData`), and modifying the firmware (`passFirmwareValidation`, `udsFirmwareModification`, `passUdsFirmwareModification`).

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines a specialized asset class for an Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which is a common controller found in vehicles. This asset class includes various attack steps, defenses, and associations to model potential threats and countermeasures in a vehicle network.\n\nThe ECU asset extends the existing `Machine` class because the original class had many unrelated attacks. The purpose of the ECU asset is to create a new parent class that accurately represents the specific attacks and connections relevant to ECUs, MCUs, or controllers.\n\n1. **Connect**: This attack step allows attackers to attempt connecting to the ECU and potentially change the operation mode if they have access to the network, services, dataflows, etc. It leads to the `attemptChangeOperationMode` attack step.\n\n2. **MaliciousFirmwareUpload**: By uploading a forged firmware, the attacker gains full access to the ECU and can inject/eavesdrop messages on the previous running services and network.\n\n3. **uploadFirmware**: Uploading firmware leads to full access on the ECU and the ability to inject/eavesdrop messages. This is a less malicious version of `maliciousFirmwareUpload`, assuming the firmware is not forged.\n\n4. **_ecuNetworkAccess**: This is a helper attack step, as both `maliciousFirmwareUpload` and `uploadFirmware` lead to the same connections. It provides access to various network-related attacks, such as eavesdropping, message injection, and specific J1939 attacks.\n\n5. **udsFirmwareModification** and **passUdsFirmwareModification**: These attack steps are reached after gaining access to the FirmwareUpdaterService. The difference between the two is that `passUdsFirmwareModification` assumes the attacker has the cryptographic key.\n\n6. **passFirmwareValidation**: If the firmware validation key is stored in the ECU, this means that the firmware validation is passed, and a new firmware can be uploaded. It leads to the `uploadFirmware` attack step.\n\n7. **fullAccess**: Attackers have full access to the ECU if they have compromised its firmware, bypassed access control, or properly authenticated themselves. This access grants the ability to manipulate connected sensors or actuators, change the operation mode, gain access to the LIN bus, bypass message conflictions, and access the ECU network.\n\n8. **idControl**: Compromising the ECU's ID allows an attacker to manipulate connected sensors or actuators.\n\n9. **offline**: When the ECU is taken offline, it's still powered on but unable to communicate on its bus. The connected sensors or actuators can be manipulated.\n\n10. **shutdown**: When the ECU is powered off, the attacker-initiated denial of service affects data and machineExecutedApps.\n\n11. **changeOperationMode**: This attack step puts the ECU into diagnostics or update mode, bypassing message conflictions and IDPS. It leads to the `shutdown` attack step, as the attacker must have achieved access to the ECU to reach this stage.\n\n12. **attemptChangeOperationMode**: Similar to `changeOperationMode`, but it requires some effort and results in the ECU being offline.\n\n13. **operationModeProtection** and **messageConflictionProtection**: These are defenses intended to prevent unauthorized changes to the operation mode or to protect against message injection, respectively. They are based on research by Charlie Miller, Chris Valasek, Pierre Kleberger, Tomas Olovsson, Erland Jonsson, and Junko Takahashi et al.\n\n14. **bypassMessageConfliction**: This attack step bypasses message confliction protection mechanisms by changing the ECU's operation mode, enabling service message injection.\n\n15. **_networkServiceMessageInjection**: Injecting forged service messages can notify about vehicle faults or report false status, potentially leading to an unresponsive ECU (TPMS). This attack is reached from network access.\n\n16. **gainLINAccessFromCAN**: This attack step involves gaining access to the LIN bus through a CAN-bus node.

{"input": "This MAL code defines a specialized component, `GatewayECU`, which represents a gateway/firewall device in a vehicle's electronic control unit (ECU) network. The purpose of this component is to act as a protective barrier against cyber threats, specifically by allowing or denying traffic based on configured rules.\n\nThe `GatewayECU` has several key components:\n\n1. `fullAccess`: This allows the ECU to have full access to the traffic on the vehicle's networks (`trafficVNetworks`) and to override any default access control settings.\n\n2. `forwarding`: This component represents the gateway's basic function of forwarding traffic. It allows traffic to flow through the gateway, potentially leading to compromise of the gateway and any associated firewall. This, in turn, results in the `connect` attack step.\n\n3. `bypassFirewall`: This component represents an attacker bypassing the gateway's firewall protection. If the firewall is disabled, the attacker can proceed to other attack steps, including `gatewayBypassIDPS`, `gatewayNoIDPS`, and `trafficVNetworks.accessUDSservices`.\n\n4. `firewallProtection`: This defense mechanism ensures that the gateway's firewall is properly configured and functional. It triggers the `bypassFirewall` component if the firewall is not enabled.\n\n5. `deny`: This attack step performs a denial-of-service attack on the connected networks.\n\n6. `idpsExists`, `idpsDoesNotExist`, `idps`, `gatewayBypassIDPS`, and `gatewayNoIDPS`: These components are related to an inline intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS). If an IDPS exists, the attacker can bypass it if the firewall is disabled (`gatewayBypassIDPS`). If an IDPS does not exist, the attacker can access the network unrestricted (`gatewayNoIDPS`).\n\n7. Various `trafficVNetworks` associations: These represent the networks the gateway ECU is connected to. They include `adversaryInTheMiddle`, `deny`, `_bypassIDPS`, `_noIDPS`, `accessNetworkLayer`, and `accessUDSservices`. These networks may be affected by the various attack steps and defenses defined in this MAL code.\n\nIn summary, this MAL code defines a gateway/firewall component for a vehicle's ECU network and outlines various attack steps and defenses related to traffic flow, firewall protection, and IDPS bypass.

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines a specific threat model for a vehicles' electronic control unit (ECU) firmware, focusing on potential attacks and defenses related to firmware updates and Secure Boot validation.\n\nThe asset in this MAL code is `Firmware`, which extends the base `VehicularApplication` class. This specifies the firmware running on an ECU as an application.\n\nThe threat model includes several attack steps:\n\n1. `maliciousFirmwareModification`: This attack attempts to perform a firmware update by either bypassing or cracking Secure Boot. It involves two sub-attacks: `bypassSecureBoot` and `crackSecureBoot`.\n\n2. `crackFirmwareValidation`: This attack attempts to crack firmware validation if it is enabled. It is associated with the `hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload` attack.\n\n3. `bypassFirmwareValidation`: This attack bypasses firmware validation if it is not enabled and is also associated with the `hardware.maliciousFirmwareUpload` attack.\n\nThe model also includes a defense mechanism: `firmwareValidation`. This defense mechanism includes code signing and verification during upload, use of strong checksum functions, and the non-distribution of private keys for signing. It aims to prevent the `bypassFirmwareValidation` attack.\n\nAdditionally, the model includes another defense mechanism: `secureBoot`. Secure Boot is a protection mechanism that validates the boot software and the firmware at system boot time. This mechanism is expected to make running of forged firmware harder when enabled, thus stopping the `bypassSecureBoot` and `crackSecureBoot` attacks.\n\nThe logical flow in this model is as follows:\n\n1. If Secure Boot is enabled, the attacker can either bypass it (`bypassSecureBoot`) or try to crack it (`crackSecureBoot`).\n2. If Secure Boot is not enabled, the attacker can directly bypass firmware validation (`bypassFirmwareValidation`).\n3.

It has two sub-attacks:\n   - `busOffAttack`: This attack exploits the error-handling scheme of in-vehicle networks to disconnect good/uncompromised Electronic Control Units (ECUs) or cause a Denial of Service (DoS) on the entire network. This attack is applicable to both traditional CAN and CAN-FD networks.\n   - `exploitArbitration`: This attack exploits the arbitration mechanism for message prioritization in CAN bus networks. By doing so, it can lead to the invalidation of legitimate messages, causing a Denial of Service, and allow message tampering or injection.\n\n2. `deny`: This is a general defense mechanism that blocks the communication of messages on the network. It can be applied in response to any attack.\n\n3. `dataflows.maliciousTransmit`: This dataflow allows the transmission of malicious messages on the network, differentiating it from the `messageInjection` attack. If successful, it enables direct malicious respond and request.\n\nThe code also includes a defense mechanism called `busOffProtection` that is based on a defense mechanism proposed in the paper \"Error Handling of In-vehicle Networks Makes Them Vulnerable (2016)\".

It is hidden from the user and is connected to `commonTimeBaseAttack`, `exploitBusGuardian`, and `sleepFrameAttack`.\n\n2. `commonTimeBaseAttack`: This attack step aims to make the entire network inoperable by sending more than the appropriate number (n/3 where n is the number of nodes) of SYNC messages within one communication cycle. The attack step is further defined with a Gaussian distribution (mean=2.0, standard deviation=5.0), indicating the expected number of SYNC messages to be sent. The reference for this attack is Marko Wolf's \"Security Engineering for Vehicular IT Systems\" published in 2009.\n\n3. `exploitBusGuardian`: This attack step utilizes the Bus Guardian, a hardened component in the FlexRay network, to send well-directed faked error messages. The goal is to deactivate controllers, requiring a significant amount of effort due to the BusGuardian's hardening. The attack step is defined with an exponential distribution (rate=0.15), indicating the probability of the attack being executed. The references for this attack are from Marko Wolf's 2009 book and a paper by Philipp Mundhenk, Sebastian Steinhorst, and Suhaib A. Fahmy published in 2015.\n\n4. `sleepFrameAttack`: This attack step sends well-directed forged sleep frames to deactivate power-saving capable FlexRay controllers.

It involves injecting header or timed responses and injecting bogus synchronization bytes.\n\n2. `injectBogusSyncBytes`: This attack step sends frames with bogus synchronization bytes within the SYNCH field, making the local LIN network inoperative or causing at least serious malfunctions.

This dataflow can be intercepted and manipulated by an attacker.\n\nAttack steps defined in this MAL code include:\n\n1. `eavesdrop`: An attacker listens to the dataflow, potentially gaining access to the contained data (which may or may not be encrypted).\n2. `adversaryInTheMiddle`: An attacker takes control of the dataflow, enabling them to manipulate the data (which may be encrypted and authenticated). This attacker can read, write, delete, or transmit the data. This attack is difficult to detect by Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS).\n3. `maliciousTransmitNoIDPS`: A malicious transmission is performed when IDPS is disabled on GatewayECU. The attacker must bypass the message confliction mechanism to achieve this.\n4. `maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection`: The attacker manages to bypass the confliction protection mechanism, allowing them to transmit malicious data. This process typically takes some time.\n5. `maliciousTransmitBypassIDPS`: The attacker manages to bypass the IDPS system, allowing them to transmit malicious data. The time required to bypass a well-tuned and updated IDPS is studied in references provided in the code.\n6. `maliciousTransmit`: The act of trying to transmit maliciously, which occurs when IDPS is not in place, allowing the attacker to make malicious transmissions unobstructed.\n7. `transmit`: The successful transmission of data through the network.\n\nAssociations between these attack steps and components are defined using the `->` and `+>` operators, which represent sequential and parallel relationships, respectively. The `&` operator defines conjunctive relationships between attack steps.\n\nFor example, the `adversaryInTheMiddle` attack step is a combination of the `eavesdrop` and other manipulative actions (`deny`, `data.write`, `data.read`, `data.delete`, and `transmit`). The `maliciousTransmitBypassConflitionProtection` attack step involves both `transmit` and `eavesdropAndBypassMsgConflictionProtection`.\n\nThe MAL code also includes probability distributions for certain attack steps, represented by the `[Exponential(0.314)]` and `[Exponential(0.613)]` notations. These distributions represent the estimated time it takes for an attacker to bypass the confliction protection mechanism or IDPS, respectively.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a detailed description of various attack steps related to connectionless dataflow in a network, along with their relationships and potential domain-specific implications.

There are three types: user info, connect privileges, and assigned vehicular identity. The user info privilege grants access to the machine, while connect privileges are granted to anyone who connects to a machine. Assigned vehicular identity is a privilege associated with a specific application.\n\n3. **VehicularApplication**: Represents an application in the vehicular network.
