{"input": "The given MAL code defines a specific domain-specific threat modeling language for Industrial Control Systems (ICS). The language extends the Meta Attack Language Core and includes assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations.\n\nThe main asset category defined is ComputeResources, which includes the following assets:\n\n1. `IcsHardware`: Represents an ICS system, extending the coreLang's System with more attack vectors. The attacker can gain physical access or full access to an ICS hardware. Full access allows for loss of safety, loss of control, loss of availability, manipulation of view, and manipulation of control.\n\n   - `moduleFirmware`: Malicious or vulnerable firmware can be installed on modular hardware devices.\n   - `moduleFirmwareVerification`, `useCryptographyKeyForFirmware`, and `useAuthenticatedFirmwareUpdates`: Mitigation techniques to verify or secure the firmware update process.\n   - `systemFirmware`: Malicious or out-of-date firmware can be uploaded through the firmware update feature on accessible devices.\n   - `lossOfSafety`, `lossOfControl`, `lossOfAvailability`, `manipulationOfView`, and `manipulationOfControl`: Attack steps representing the potential impact of an attack on the ICS system.\n   - `deny`, `attemptPreemptiveShutdown`, `attemptPreemptiveShutdownOnSafetyLoss`, `attemptShutdown`, `attemptUnsafeState`, `unsafeState`, `safetyMechanismsOffline`, `shutdown`, `triggerPropagateRedundantShutdown`, `damageToProperty`, and `lossOfProductivityAndRevenue`: Additional attack steps and their relationships that model potential impacts on the ICS system.\n\n2. `IcsApplication`: Represents an ICS application, extending the coreLang's Application with OT attack vectors. Attackers can gain specific access or full access to an ICS application. Full access allows for normal operation, attempt manipulation, and restricted operation.\n\n   - `specificAccess`, `fullAccess`, `normalOperation`, `restrictedOperation`, `read`, `deny`, `attemptCovertManipulation`, `attemptManipulation`, `manipulate`, `lossOfControl`, `lossOfView`, `manipulationOfControl`, `manipulationOfView`, `theftOfOperationalInformation`: Attack steps representing the potential impact of an attack on the ICS application.\n\n3. `Sensor`, `Actuator`, and `SynchronizationModule`: These assets represent specific components in the ICS system, such as sensors, actuators, and synchronization modules, and their potential attack vectors.\n\nThe associations define the relationships between the assets, such as IcsHardware having criticalParentSystem, redundantParentSystem, and safeguardedSystem, and IcsApplication having signalSourceApp, signalDestApp, controlSignalSourceApp, controlSignalDestApp, synchronizedApp, and so on.\n\nThe language also includes domain-specific implications, such as the potential for supply chain attacks, replication through removable media, and MITRE ATT&CK ICS techniques. The language is intended to help model and analyze threats to ICS systems more effectively.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ICSlang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ninclude \"org.mal-lang.coreLang/coreLang.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/Controller.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/ControlServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/DataHistorian.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/EngineeringWorkstation.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/HMI.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/IOServer.mal\"\ninclude \"ics/SIS.mal\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"input": "The provided code defines a domain-specific threat modeling language for cybersecurity focused on Industrial Control Systems (ICS), using the Meta Attack Language (MAL). This MAL implementation, named ComputeResources, models various assets, attack steps, defenses, and associations related to ICS threats.\n\nAssets:\n- IcsHardware: Extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors, such as physical and full access, as well as specific attack steps like manipulation of control and view, and loss of safety, control, view, availability, productivity, and revenue.\n- IcsApplication: Extends the coreLang's Application with OT attack vectors, including specific access, full access, normal operation, restricted operation, read, deny, attempt covert manipulation, and attempt manipulation.\n- Sensor: An object that generates data but may not have any associated software or host.\n- Actuator: An object that consumes data but may not have any associated software or host.\n- SynchronizationModule: Represents any component that provides synchronization capabilities, such as a GPS receiver or a network-based synchronization module.\n\nAttack Steps:\n- ManipulateSignal, blockSignal, attemptWrite, attemptDeny, manipulation of control, loss of control, manipulation of view, loss of view, theft of operational information, manipulateClockFrequency, manipulateTime, stopClock: These steps represent various ways an adversary can manipulate, block, write, deny, or steal data, and cause loss of control, view, or synchronization in the ICS system.\n\nDefenses:\n- moduleFirmwareVerification, useCryptographyKeyForFirmware, useAuthenticatedFirmwareUpdates: These defenses aim to mitigate the risk of firmware alteration in modular hardware devices and accessible devices.\n\nAssociations:\n- IcsHardware has associations with moduleFirmware, systemFirmware, lossOfSafety, lossOfControl, lossOfAvailability, manipulationOfView, manipulationOfControl, safetyMechanismsOffline, shutdown, damageToProperty, lossOfProductivityAndRevenue.\n- IcsApplication has associations with specificAccess, fullAccess, normalOperation, restrictedOperation, read, deny, attemptCovertManipulation, attemptManipulation, manipulationOfControl, lossOfControl, manipulationOfView, lossOfView, theftOfOperationalInformation.\n- Sensor has associations with physicalAccess, signal, system, lossOfView, manipulationOfView.\n- Actuator has associations with manipulate, block, system, manipulationOfControl, lossOfControl.\n- SynchronizationModule has associations with compromise, manipulateClockFrequency, manipulateTime, stopClock, synchronizedApp.\n\nThe logical flow and relationships between elements in this MAL code are based on the MITRE ATT&CK ICS framework, which provides a structured list of known attack techniques that adversaries have used against ICS systems. The code models these techniques in a structured way, allowing analysts to create threat models for ICS systems and identify potential vulnerabilities and mitigations.\n\nThis MAL implementation also includes probabilistic modeling for certain attack steps to represent the likelihood of an attack occurring, as well as propagation mechanisms for parent systems to reflect the impact of attacks on subsystems. Additionally, some components can be removed or disabled to model specific use cases.\n\nOverall, this MAL code provides a comprehensive and structured way to model threats to ICS systems, helping analysts to identify potential vulnerabilities, assess risks, and develop effective defenses.", "output": "category ComputeResources {\n\n    asset IcsHardware extends Hardware\n      user info: \"An ICS System extends the coreLang's System with more attack vectors.\"\n      developer info: \"For example, the attacker can additionally peform ATT&CK ICS T847 'Replication Through Removable Media', T862 'Supply Chain Attack' and more.\"\n    {\n      | physicalAccess @Override\n        +>  moduleFirmware,\n            systemFirmware\n\n      | fullAccess @Override\n        +>  lossOfSafety,\n            lossOfControl,\n            lossOfAvailability,\n            manipulationOfView,\n            manipulationOfControl\n\n      & moduleFirmware\n        user info: \"Adversaries may install malicious or vulnerable firmware onto modular hardware devices.

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines several assets and their associated attack steps, defenses, and relationships in the context of a cybersecurity threat modeling language. The assets include Signal, ControlSignal, IcsData, and IcsControlData.\n\n1. **Signal**: This asset represents information that is sent between two assets, regardless of the medium of transmission. It has several basic attack steps: attemptAccess, access, attemptRead, attemptWrite, and attemptDelete. Additionally, it has an intermediate attack step, accessDecryptedData, which allows effects of 'accessUnencryptedData' on data after compromising the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled. The dataNotPresent attack step models the probability of data not existing on the connected container.\n\n2. **ControlSignal**: This asset extends Signal and represents control commands sent between two assets. It overrides the manipulateSignal and blockSignal attack steps to account for the specific nature of control commands.\n\n3. **IcsData**: This asset extends the Data asset from the coreLang and adds OT attack vectors and directionality for non-control information. It overrides the successfulWrite, successfulDelete, and successfulDeny attack steps to account for the specific nature of OT networks.\n\n4. **IcsControlData**: This asset also extends the Data asset from the coreLang and adds OT attack vectors and directionality for control information. It overrides the successfulWrite, successfulDelete, and successfulDeny attack steps to account for the specific nature of OT networks and control information.\n\nThe logical flow of the attack steps can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. attemptAccess -> access -> attemptRead, attemptWrite, attemptDelete (if data is unencrypted)\n2. If data is encrypted:\n   - attemptAccess -> access -> encryptCreds (to access the associated encryption credentials/key) -> accessUnencryptedData\n3. If data is authenticated: write -> write (modifying the data is not possible)\n4. If data is unencrypted: accessUnencryptedData -> accessDecryptedData (allows effects of 'accessUnencryptedData' on data after compromising the encryption credentials or encryption is disabled) -> readContainedInformationAndData, read, write, delete\n5. If dataNotPresent: accessUnencryptedData\n6. readContainedInformationAndData -> information.read, containedData.read\n7. attemptRead -> read\n8. attemptWrite -> write\n9. attemptDelete -> delete\n10. manipulateSignal: signalDestApp.manipulationOfView (for normal Signal) or signalActuator.manipulate, controlSignalDestApp.manipulationOfControl (for ControlSignal)\n11. blockSignal: signalDestApp.lossOfView (for normal Signal) or signalActuator.block, controlSignalDestApp.lossOfControl (for ControlSignal)\n\nIn the context of Industrial Control Systems (ICS), these assets and attack steps can be used to model threats and vulnerabilities in OT networks, such as data manipulation, data deletion, and control command manipulation or denial. The domain-specific implications are particularly relevant for ICS systems, where the manipulation or denial of control commands can have serious consequences, such as causing equipment malfunction or process disruptions.", "output": "category DataResources {\n\n    asset Signal\n      user info: \"A signal represents information that is sent between two assets but the medium over which is transmitted is not relevant to the model.\"\n      modeler info: \"In the case where data or information are transmitted over a known medium, the IcsData asset and the DataInTransit association should be used instead.\"\n      developer info: \"The basic attack steps of this asset were inspired by the attack steps of the data asset in coreLang.\"\n    {\n      // Basic attack steps below\n      | attemptAccess\n          user info: \"Attempt to access the data, this might fail if the 'dataNotPresent' defense is used.\"\n          ->  access\n\n        & access\n          user info: \"Access the data.\"\n          ->  attemptRead,\n              attemptWrite,\n              attemptDelete\n\n        !E dataEncrypted @hidden\n          user info: \"If the data are encrypted then accessing them requires the associated encryption credentials/key.\"\n          developer info: \"Data will be considered as encrypted if there is at least one Credentials instance associated with it.
