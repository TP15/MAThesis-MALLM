They can either access or execute activities and have an impact on logical nodes.\n\n2. **Product Category**: This category defines assets related to the electronic and communication devices in the power substation. Assets include LogicalDevice, LogicalNode, IED, Server, Data, Router, and Clock.\n\n   - LogicalDevice contains one or more LogicalNodes.\n   - LogicalNodes can host one or more servers and can handle data. They can also communicate with other entities such as AccessPoints, IEDs, SubNetworks, Routers, Clocks, and other LogicalNodes.\n   - IEDs have access and communication capabilities.

Understanding these relationships is crucial for threat modeling, as it allows for the identification of potential attack paths and vulnerabilities.", "output": "associations {\n        Clock [clock] 0..1 <-- Communication --> 1 [accessPoint] AccessPoint\n        Function [function] * <-- Communication --> * [logicalNode] LogicalNode\n        IED [ied] 1 <-- Communication --> 1..* [accessPoint] AccessPoint\n        LogicalDevice [logicalDev] 1 <-- Contains --> * [logicalNode] LogicalNode\n        LogicalDevice [logicalDev] 1..* <-- HostedOn --> 1 [server] Server\n        LogicalNode [logicalNode] * <-- Communication --> * [accessPoint] AccessPoint\n        LogicalNode [logicalNode] 1 <-- Handles --> 1..* [data] Data\n        LogicalNode [logicalNode] * <-- Communication --> 1 [conNode] ConnectivityNode\n        LogicalNode [logicalNode] * <-- Communication --> 1 [transformer] Transformer\n        LogicalNode [logicalNode] * <-- Communication --> * [equipment] Equipment\n        LogicalNode [logicalNode] * <-- Communication --> * [subEquipment] SubEquipment\n        Router [router] 0..1 <-- Communication --> 1 [accessPoint] AccessPoint\n        Server [server] 0..1 <-- Communication --> 1..* [accessPoint] AccessPoint\n        Subfunction [subfunction] * <-- Communication --> * [logicalNode] LogicalNode\n        SubNetwork [subNet] 1 <-- Has --> 1..* [accessPoint] AccessPoint\n        Terminal [terminal] * <-- Communication --> 1 [equipment] Equipment\n        Terminal [terminal] * <-- Communication --> 1 [conNode] ConnectivityNode\n}", "type": "association"}
