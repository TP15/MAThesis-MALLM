{"input": "The MAL code provided defines a category named \"ComputeResources\" which models various assets related to computer systems, software, and networks. The assets include:\n\n1. `Hardware`: Represents the physical hardware on which applications can run. It includes attack steps for gaining physical access, exploiting vulnerabilities, and spreading worms through removable media. There are also defenses for hardware modifications protection and supply chain auditing.\n\n2. `SoftwareProduct`: Represents a specific software package potentially with associated vulnerabilities or compromised deployment repositories. It can compromise associated applications and trigger vulnerability impacts on them.\n\n3. `Application`: Represents any type of software process or component, from firmware and operating systems to plugins and sessions. It includes attack steps for gaining access, exploiting vulnerabilities, and performing unsafe user activities. There are also defenses for IDPS effectiveness and supply chain auditing.\n\n4. `IDPS`: An Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) tasked with protecting other applications from malicious activity. It has an effectiveness defense that represents how capable the IDPS is to prevent disruptions from occurring on the associated applications.\n\n5. `PhysicalZone`: Represents the location where hardware systems and networks are physically deployed. Gaining physical access to a physical zone grants physical access to the housed hardware and networks.\n\nThe associations between these assets include hosting relationships (Hardware hosting Applications, Applications hosting other Applications), protection relationships (IDPS protecting Applications), association with SoftwareProducts (Applications associated with SoftwareProducts), and inclusion relationships for PhysicalZones (PhysicalZones including Hardware Systems and Networks).\n\nThe logical flow of the model is as follows: An attacker may gain physical access to a PhysicalZone, which grants physical access to the housed Hardware Systems and Networks. They can then attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the Hardware, Software, or Applications within the systems or networks. Applications can be associated with SoftwareProducts, which can introduce additional vulnerabilities. IDPSes can provide protection to the applications they are assigned to. The model also includes defenses for hardware modifications and supply chain auditing.", "output": "#id: \"org.mal_lang.ConputerResourceslang\"\n#version: \"1.0.0\"\n\ncategory ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

{"input": "The provided MAL code defines a ComputeResources category, which models the threat landscape related to compute resources, such as hardware systems, software applications, and network connections. This category includes several assets, including Hardware, SoftwareProduct, Application, IDPS, and PhysicalZone, each with specific components and associated attack steps, defenses, and relationships.\n\n1. Hardware: This asset represents the physical hardware on which applications can run. It includes several attack steps such as attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess, successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess, attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia, successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia, and physicalAccess. These attack steps model various methods an attacker can use to exploit vulnerabilities or spread malware on the hardware.\n\n   The Hardware asset also has defenses such as hardwareModificationsProtection and supplyChainAuditing. These defenses aim to protect the hardware against unauthorized modifications and help detect possible supply chain attacks.\n\n2. SoftwareProduct: This asset represents a specific software package, potentially even a version, which can be associated with certain vulnerabilities or have its deployment repositories compromised in a software supply chain attack. It includes the compromiseApplications attack step, which models the impact of a software supply chain attack on associated applications.\n\n3. Application: This asset represents any type of software process or component, from firmware and operating systems to plugins and sessions. It includes several attack steps such as attemptUseVulnerability, attemptReverseReach, localConnect, networkConnectUninspected, networkConnectInspected, networkConnect, specificAccessNetworkConnect, accessNetworkAndConnections, attemptNetworkConnectFromResponse, specificAccess, bypassContainerization, authenticate, specificAccessAuthenticate, localAccess, networkAccess, fullAccess, physicalAccessAchieved, attemptUnsafeUserActivity, successfulUnsafeUserActivity, unsafeUserActivity, attackerUnsafeUserActivityCapability, attackerUnsafeUserActivityCapabilityWithReverseReach, attackerUnsafeUserActivityCapabilityWithoutReverseReach, supplyChainAuditing, bypassSupplyChainAuditing, attemptFullAccessFromSupplyChainCompromise, fullAccessFromSupplyChainCompromise, attemptReadFromSoftProdVulnerability, attemptModifyFromSoftProdVulnerability, attemptDenyFromSoftProdVulnerability, softwareProductVulnerabilityLocalAccessAchieved, softwareProductVulnerabilityNetworkAccessAchieved, softwareProductVulnerabilityPhysicalAccessAchieved, softwareProductVulnerabilityLowPrivilegesAchieved, softwareProductVulnerabilityHighPrivilegesAchieved, softwareProductVulnerabilityUserInteractionAchieved, attemptSoftwareProductAbuse, softwareProductAbuse, readFromSoftProdVulnerability, modifyFromSoftProdVulnerability, denyFromSoftProdVulnerability, attemptApplicationRespondConnectThroughData, successfulApplicationRespondConnectThroughData, applicationRespondConnectThroughData, attemptAuthorizedApplicationRespondConnectThroughData, successfulAuthorizedApplicationRespondConnectThroughData, authorizedApplicationRespondConnectThroughData, attemptRead, successfulRead, read, attemptModify, successfulModify, modify, attemptDeny, successfulDeny, deny, attemptRead, specificAccessRead, attemptModify, specificAccessModify, attemptDeny, denyFromNetworkingAsset, denyFromLockout.\n\n   The Application asset also has defenses such as protectorIDPSs and softwareCheck. These defenses protect against various types of attacks, including exploiting vulnerabilities and unsafe user actions.\n\n4. IDPS: This asset represents an Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) that is tasked with protecting other applications from malicious activity. It includes the notPresent, effectiveness, and bypassEffectiveness components. The effectiveness defense represents how capable the IDPS is to prevent disruptions from occurring on the associated applications.\n\n5. PhysicalZone: This asset represents the location where hardware systems and networks are physically deployed. It includes the gainPhysicalAccess attack step.\n\nThe MAL code logically flows by defining assets and their associated components, including attack steps, defenses, and relationships. The structure is designed to model the threat landscape related to compute resources, allowing analysts to understand potential attack vectors and identify vulnerabilities. The code also highlights domain-specific implications, such as software supply chain attacks and the impact of bypassing various defenses.", "output": "category ComputeResources {\n\n    asset Hardware\n      user info: \"Specifies the hardware on which applications can run.\"\n    {\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  useVulnerability\n\n      | useVulnerability\n        user info: \"The attacker is able to use the associated vulnerabilities, usually as a result of obtaining physical access.\"\n        ->  vulnerabilities.attemptAbuse\n\n      | attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        ->  successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia,\n            bypassHardwareModificationsProtection\n\n      & successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        ->  spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia @hidden\n        developer info: \"Try to spread malware through removable media that the users connect to the hardware system.\"\n        ->  (users \\/ physicalZones.users).attemptDeliverMaliciousRemovableMedia\n\n      | fullAccess {C,I,A}\n        user info: \"Full access on a piece of hardware grants full access on the applications running on it and access to the hosted data.\"\n        ->  sysExecutedApps.fullAccess,\n            hostedData.attemptRead,\n            hostedData.attemptWrite,\n            deny,\n            attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia\n\n      | attemptSupplyChainAttack @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Adversaries may perform supply chain compromise attacks to gain control of hardware before it is put into use.\"\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to allow for defenses and trigger bypasses.\"\n        modeler info: \"Triggering this attack step is the only way to model hardware supply chain attacks in the language, therefore scenarios interested in those aspects need to employ it as an entry point.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack,\n            bypassSupplyChainAuditing\n\n      & successfulSupplyChainAttack @hidden\n        developer info: \"Intermediate attack step to model defenses.\"\n        -> supplyChainAttack\n\n      | supplyChainAttack [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"A supply chain compromise means that the attacker has gained full access of the hardware.\"\n        modeler info: \"The Hardware supply chain attack represents an attacker being able to tamper with the hardware/firmware before the deployment of the product and not alterations made to the hardware/firmware once it is operating.\"\n        ->  fullAccess\n\n      # supplyChainAuditing\n        user info: \"Auditing inside the hardware supply chain can detect possible supply chain attacks.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | bypassSupplyChainAuditing [VeryHardAndUncertain]\n        user info: \"Supply chain auditing can be bypassed.\"\n        ->  supplyChainAuditingBypassed\n\n      | supplyChainAuditingBypassed @hidden\n        developer info: \"Supply chain auditing is bypassed either because it was not set or the attacker was able to circumvent it through additional effort.\"\n        ->  successfulSupplyChainAttack\n\n      | physicalAccess @entrypoint\n        user info: \"Attacker has physical access to the location where the hardware is physically deployed.

{"input": "This MAL code defines a set of attack steps and defenses related to hardware assets in a cybersecurity threat modeling context. The main objective is to model various attack scenarios involving hardware, such as physical access, supply chain compromise, worm spreading through removable media, and unsafe user activities.\n\nThe hardware asset in this MAL code is divided into several components:\n\n1. `attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, `successfulUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, `attemptUseVulnerabilityFromSoftwareFullAccess`, and `useVulnerability` represent the steps where an attacker exploits a vulnerability, usually after gaining physical access or full software access to the hardware.\n\n2. `attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, `successfulSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, and `spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia` model the steps where a worm spreads through removable media connected to the hardware.\n\n3. `fullAccess {C,I,A}` represents the state where an attacker has full access to the hardware, allowing them to execute applications, read and write hosted data.\n\n4. `attemptSupplyChainAttack` and `successfulSupplyChainAttack` model the steps where an attacker compromises the hardware before it is put into use (supply chain compromise).\n\n5. `supplyChainAuditing`, `bypassSupplyChainAuditing`, and `supplyChainAuditingBypassed` represent the defense and bypasses related to supply chain auditing.\n\n6. `physicalAccess`, `attemptHardwareModifications`, `successfulHardwareModifications`, and related steps model physical access and unauthorized hardware modifications.\n\n7. `hardwareModificationsProtection`, `bypassHardwareModificationsProtection`, and `hardwareModificationsProtectionBypassed` represent the defense and bypasses related to hardware modifications protection.\n\n8. `attemptUnsafeUserActivity`, `successfulUnsafeUserActivity`, and `unsafeUserActivity` model unsafe user activities, such as connecting a malicious removable media drive.\n\n9. `deny`, `read`, and `modify` represent denial of service, read, and modify attacks on the hardware, respectively.\n\nThe logical flow in this MAL code typically involves intermediate attack steps (e.g., `attemptUseVulnerabilityFromPhysicalAccess`, `attemptSpreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, `attemptUnsafeUserActivity`) leading to more complex attack sequences (e.g., `useVulnerability`, `spreadWormThroughRemovableMedia`, `unsafeUserActivity`). Defenses and bypasses are modeled as intermediate attack steps as well, allowing for the exploration of different defense scenarios and their potential bypasses.\n\nThis MAL code has specific implications for hardware cybersecurity, as it allows for modeling various attack scenarios related to hardware assets, including physical access, supply chain compromise, and unsafe user activities.

{"input": "Description:\n\nThe provided MAL code defines a specific asset type called `SoftwareProduct`, which represents a specific software package that certain applications use. This asset type was introduced to improve the usability of the language and enable the modeling of software supply chain attacks.\n\nThe `SoftwareProduct` asset has three main components:\n\n1. `compromiseApplications`: This component represents a software supply chain attack on the `SoftwareProduct`. If the origin of the software product is compromised (modified maliciously), it is interpreted as a software supply chain attack, and the associated applications should also be fully compromised.\n\n2. `write @Override`: This component signifies the ability of the attacker to write the software product. If the attacker is able to write the software product, they are able to execute a software supply chain attack on the applications associated with it.\n\n3. `readApplications @hidden`, `modifyApplications @hidden`, and `denyApplications @hidden`: These components are intermediary attack steps used to propagate specific types of attacks (read, modify, and deny, respectively) on all of the associated applications if the `SoftwareProduct`'s vulnerabilities have the corresponding impact (confidentiality, integrity, or availability). These steps are marked as hidden, indicating they are not intended to be directly invoked but rather used to model the propagation of attacks from the software product to its associated applications.\n\nThe logical flow of the MAL code is as follows:\n\n1. If the `SoftwareProduct` is compromised (`compromiseApplications`), the associated applications are fully compromised.\n2. If the attacker is able to write the `SoftwareProduct` (`write @Override`), it triggers a software supply chain attack on the applications associated with it.\n3.

If a `SoftwareProduct`'s vulnerability has an integrity impact, it triggers the `modifyApplications` step, which in turn attempts to modify the associated applications.\n5. If a `SoftwareProduct`'s vulnerability has an availability impact, it triggers the `denyApplications` step, which in turn attempts to deny access to the associated applications.\n\nThe domain-specific implications of this MAL code are related to software supply chain security.

For example, an operating system can run a virtual machine, which in turn can run an application.\n\n3. **IDPS [protectedApps] <-- AppProtection --> * [protectedApps]**: This association indicates that Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) can provide protection to other applications. This protection is applied to the applications, not directly to the hardware or networks.\n\n4. **SoftwareProduct [softApplications] <-- AppSoftwareProduct --> * [applications]**: This association links applications to the software products they are associated with. A software product may have specific characteristics such as specific vulnerabilities and deployment repositories.\n\n5. **PhysicalZone [hardwareSystems] <-- ZoneInclusion --> * [physicalZones]**: This association represents the relationship between physical zones and hardware systems or networks. Access to a physical zone provides physical access to the hardware or network deployed in that zone. However, access to the hardware or network does not provide access to the physical zone. For example, access to a server's iLO (Integrated Lights-Out) does not necessarily mean access to the physical zone where the server is located.\n\n6. **PhysicalZone [networks] <-- ZoneInclusion --> * [physicalZones]**: This association is similar to the previous one but for networks. Access to a physical zone provides physical access to the networks deployed within that zone, but access to the network does not provide access to the physical zone.", "output": "associations {\n  Hardware         [hostHardware]      0..1 <-- SysExecution          --> *    [sysExecutedApps]        Application\n      user info: \"Hardware on which Applications are running.
