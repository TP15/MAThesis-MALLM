{"instruction": "Use Meta Attack Language to define a category that encompasses the following assets.", "input": "In the realm of Identity and Access Management (IAM), we encounter various assets that play a crucial role in securing access to systems and data. One such category is the IAMObject, which serves as the base logic for all IAM assets, encompassing identities, groups, and privileges.\n\nAn IAMObject represents the fundamental logic for IAM roles like Identity, Group, and Privileges. It's essential to consider potential attack vectors by modeling scenarios where these objects may not exist. In such cases, we should disable all impactful attack steps related to the IAMObject.\n\nAttack steps related to an IAMObject primarily revolve around assuming, denying, writing, or locking out identities, groups, or privileges. For instance, when an attacker successfully assumes an IAM asset, they can exploit the associated privileges. This could lead to executing applications, reading and writing data, or even deleting data, depending on the specific asset.\n\nIdentities, a subcategory of IAMObjects, model IAM identities that should be associated with privileges on other instances. They can be visualized as a group of assumable roles that can be associated with many credentials. If an identity is compromised, it's assumed that all associated privileges are also compromised, and the parent identities (on the above level/inherited by this identity) should also be considered compromised because those represent the group of (inherited) roles.\n\nGroups, another subcategory of IAMObjects, are used to group together identities and/or other groups, allowing for hierarchical IAM. If an identity of a group is compromised, the whole group (i.e., all other privileges of the group) should be considered compromised, and the parent groups should also be considered compromised.\n\nPrivileges, the last subcategory, can be associated with another IAMObject to reason about a specific subset of given privileges on applications and data. They are used as a speculative asset when reasoning about additional privileges that a particular group or identity may have as a result of either poor configurations or the attacker's actions.\n\nCredentials, a separate asset, can be used to gain access to an Identity but can also be used as an encryption/signing key for Data. They represent a variety of access control mechanisms like username and password pairs, keycards, biometric data, etc. Attack steps related to Credentials involve reading, writing, denying, or using them, potentially leading to various consequences, such as unauthorized access, data decryption, or data spoofing.", "output": "category IAM {\n\n    abstract asset IAMObject extends Information\n      user info: \"An IAM object represents the base logic shared by all assets used for Identity and Access Management roles(Identity, Group, Privileges).\"\n    {\n      # notPresent [Disabled]\n        user info: \"This defense is used to reason about the attack vectors introduced by this asset.
